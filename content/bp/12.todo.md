## Ideas

- Different styles of citations, Harvard etc. Samwell AI for example
- We could have a panelist of people selected from our userbase through application, their job is to
  act as mentors / a sounding board for us, similar to a board of directors. Might appeal to retired
  experts, people seeking status in industry. We should also rotate the board every 3 years.
- Add social share buttons to content Allow users to connect their social media accounts, so when they
  post on astronEra we automatically post on the other social platforms as well.
- Allow users to upload a PDF if we do not have it in our database, it will then be chunked and they can  perform rag search on it.

## What are we missing:

# Websites to scrape

- DarkSky.org
- OAD / IAU websites
- NASA website
- Heavens dash above website
- Space.com 
- Sky and Telescope
- Linkedin for Companies and Jobs
- https://whed.net/results_institutions.php - universities
- https://orcid.org/ researchers database, has cite count, can search by Astronomy etc.
- Can potentially find citations from this website if Arxiv papers don't have links, just titles. https://www.semanticscholar.org/
- https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/ for papers
- https://www.classcentral.com/subject/astronomy for courses in astronomy from all platforms, also for youtube, can search for specific things like Black Holes
