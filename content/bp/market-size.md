### Researchers

2. **Professional and Educational Sectors:**

   - **Professional Use:** The space sector's professional use includes applications in agriculture,
     construction, insurance, and climate change mitigation. Earth observation satellites provide
     critical data for environmental monitoring, disaster response, and resource management.
   - **Educational Initiatives:** Governments and private entities are increasingly investing in
     space education, recognizing its strategic importance. This is fostering a new generation of
     space professionals and enthusiasts, with programs aimed at students from various educational
     levels.

To estimate the total number of active PhDs in astronomy, we'll use the following steps:

1. **Determine the average length of a professional career.**
2. **Use the annual number of PhDs awarded to calculate the cumulative number of active PhDs.**
3. **Apply the growth rate to account for yearly increases.**

### Data Recap
- **Total degrees awarded in Astronomy & Astrophysics in the US (2022):** 1,396
- **Growth rate in degrees awarded:** 1.53%
- **Average length of a professional career:** Typically around 35-40 years.

### Assumptions
1. **Average career length:** We'll use 37.5 years as the midpoint of the average professional career span.
2. **Annual growth:** We'll apply the growth rate annually to account for increases in the number of PhDs awarded.

### Calculation Steps
1. **Calculate the cumulative number of active PhDs over 37.5 years.**
2. **Account for the annual growth rate.**

### Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **Cumulative sum without growth:** 

\[
\text{Total Active PhDs} = \text{Annual PhDs awarded} \times \text{Average career length}
\]

Without accounting for growth:

\[
\text{Total Active PhDs} = 1,396 \times 37.5 = 52,350
\]

2. **Account for growth rate:**

To account for the annual growth rate, we need to sum the geometric series of PhDs awarded over the career span. The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:

\[
S_n = a \frac{(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}
\]

Where:
- \(a\) is the initial number of PhDs awarded annually.
- \(r\) is the growth rate per year.
- \(n\) is the number of years (37.5).

Here, \(a = 1,396\), \(r = 1 + 0.0153 = 1.0153\), and \(n = 37.5\).

\[
S_{37.5} = 1,396 \frac{(1 - 1.0153^{37.5})}{1 - 1.0153}
\]

Calculating the exponent:

\[
1.0153^{37.5} \approx 1.765
\]

Now, substituting back into the formula:

\[
S_{37.5} = 1,396 \frac{(1 - 1.765)}{1 - 1.0153} = 1,396 \frac{(-0.765)}{-0.0153} \approx 1,396 \times 50 = 69,800
\]

### Summary
Based on the data provided and assumptions made, the estimated total number of active PhDs in Astronomy & Astrophysics fields globally, considering an average professional career length of 37.5 years and a growth rate of 1.53%, is approximately **69,800**.

## Amateur Astronomers:

3. **Enthusiast Market:**
   - **Consumer Applications:** The space sector also targets enthusiasts through applications such
     as space tourism, amateur astronomy, and educational content. The decreasing cost of space
     technology is making these activities more accessible to a broader audience.



### Globally

To estimate the global number of amateur astronomers, we can use data from various sources and extrapolate based on known figures from specific countries. Here's a step-by-step approach to create an estimation range:

1. **United States Data**:
   - The U.S. has approximately 100,000 active amateur astronomers【32†source】【33†source】.
   - The U.S. population is around 332 million.

2. **Proportion of Amateurs in the U.S.**:
   - Proportion of amateur astronomers in the U.S. = 100,000 / 332,000,000 ≈ 0.03%.

3. **Extrapolation to Other Developed Countries**:
   - Assuming a similar proportion in other developed countries (e.g., Europe, Japan, Australia):
   - Total population of developed countries (approximate): 1.2 billion.
   - Estimated number of amateur astronomers: 1,200,000,000 * 0.03% = 360,000.

4. **Adjusting for Global Population**:
   - Global population is approximately 7.8 billion.
   - Developing countries may have lower participation rates due to different socio-economic factors. Let's estimate a lower rate (e.g., 0.01%).

5. **Estimations**:
   - Developed countries: 360,000 amateur astronomers.
   - Developing countries: 6.6 billion * 0.01% = 660,000 amateur astronomers.
   - Total estimated range: 360,000 (developed) + 660,000 (developing) = 1,020,000 amateur astronomers globally.

### Estimation Range
Given the variability and uncertainty in participation rates and the broader definitions of what constitutes an amateur astronomer, it's reasonable to consider a range:

- **Lower Estimate**: 800,000 amateur astronomers globally.
- **Upper Estimate**: 1,500,000 amateur astronomers globally.

### Sources and Considerations:
- **Cloudy Nights Forum Discussions**: Provides anecdotal evidence and estimates based on participation in astronomy clubs and societies.
- **Astronomy Clubs and Societies**: Membership numbers can give a snapshot but are often underrepresented.
- **Magazine Circulations and Telescope Sales**: Proxy indicators of interest and participation in amateur astronomy.

These estimates provide a rough range and should be interpreted with caution due to the diverse and often informal nature of amateur astronomy communities worldwide.

### India

Based on the global estimation of amateur astronomers, we can use this to estimate the number of amateur astronomers in India.

### Global Estimation Recap
- **Lower Estimate**: 800,000 amateur astronomers globally.
- **Upper Estimate**: 1,500,000 amateur astronomers globally.

### India's Population Proportion
India accounts for approximately 17.7% of the world's population. We can use this proportion to estimate the number of amateur astronomers in India.

### Calculation
- **Lower Estimate**:
  - Global estimate: 800,000 amateur astronomers
  - India's share (17.7%): 800,000 * 0.177 ≈ 141,600

- **Upper Estimate**:
  - Global estimate: 1,500,000 amateur astronomers
  - India's share (17.7%): 1,500,000 * 0.177 ≈ 265,500

### Final Estimation Range for India
Therefore, based on global proportions, the estimated number of amateur astronomers in India would range from approximately **141,600 to 265,500**.

This estimation provides a reasonable range, considering India's significant population and growing interest in astronomy, further supported by active astronomy clubs and educational outreach programs.
