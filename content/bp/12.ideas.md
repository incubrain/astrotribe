We could have a panelist of people selected from our userbase through application, their job is to
act as mentors / a sounding board for us, similar to a board of directors. Might appeal to retired
experts, people seeking status in industry. We should also rotate the board every 3 years.

**Audience:**

- **Astronomy Professionals:** Stay updated with news, find job openings, use AI tools for work,
  network with peers, grow a following, find resources/tools.
- **Students:** Set up career paths, find jobs/internships, study planning, research help, find
  resources/tools.
- **Science Communicators/Influencers:** Access to resources, simplify complex topics with AI,
  expand reach, promote content.
- **Astronomy Businesses:** Outreach and awareness, talent acquisition, promote jobs, customize
  profiles, interact with users.
- **Enthusiasts:** Stay updated with news, one-stop-shop for astronomy needs, connect with
  professionals, explore career shifts.

Add social share buttons to content Allow users to connect their social media accounts, so when they
post on astronEra we automatically post on the other social platforms as well.

Allow users to upload a PDF if we do not have it in our database, it will then be chunked and they can perform rag search on it.

## What are we missing:

# ideas:

- Different styles of citations, Harvard etc. Samwell AI for example

# Websites to scrape

- DarkSky.org
- OAD / IAU websites
- NASA website
- Heavens dash above website
- Space.com 
- Sky and Telescope
- Linkedin for Companies and Jobs
- https://whed.net/results_institutions.php - universities
- https://orcid.org/ researchers database, has cite count, can search by Astronomy etc.
- Can potentially find citations from this website if Arxiv papers don't have links, just titles. https://www.semanticscholar.org/
- https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/ for papers
- https://www.classcentral.com/subject/astronomy for courses in astronomy from all platforms, also for youtube, can search for specific things like Black Holes
