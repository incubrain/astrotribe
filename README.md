## Project Guidelines

- Nuxt | Script setup and composition API
- Domain Driven Design
- Focus on automation, building out our CI
- Less Complexity is always good
- Try to remove parts before adding
- Reuse code when possible
- Start simple, but think of scale
- Modular is generally better, we should be able to swap out parts easily
