    "quote": "Astronomy has always seemed beyond our reach. Not just because it studies the universe beyond the Earth's atmosphere, but because there are very few avenues for the ordinary citizens to study it. AstronEra is changing that. AstronEra is doing magical work. Scientifically. It is making Astronomy accessible, enjoyable and within reach for citizens around the world."
