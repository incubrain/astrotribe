    bio: 'Astropreneur Shweta Kulkarni, listed among top 100 women entrepreneurs, spearheads Astronera, marrying business acumen with astronomy for innovative solutions. As a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society of England, her venture reflects a novel approach to integrating astronomy with enterprise.',

      title: 'Skill Training in Astronomy for Income Generation',
      description: `Shweta, the director of AstronEra and CEO of Astron
        SHK Trust, initiated the conference to bridge the link between conserving dark skies and
        sustainable socio-economic development. She introduced herself as an "AstroPreneur,"
        emphasizing her dual roles as a part-time astronomer and full-time entrepreneur. Shweta
        identified key problems including the lack of authentic astronomy knowledge, scientific
        temperament in society, and diminishing dark skies due to light pollution.
        She introduced the "AstroTribe" Project, funded by IAU and OAD, aimed at training tribal
        children in astronomy to empower them economically. This initiative incentivizes students by
        enabling them to generate income through bridging technical astronomy with entertainment
        through astrotourism, thereby promoting awareness about dark skies and addressing SDGs of
        quality education and sustainable economic growth.
        Shweta outlined action points post-conference, focusing on understanding the problem of
        light pollution, identifying target areas and audiences, determining mediums and expected
        outcomes, and establishing frameworks aligned with the human right to dark skies. She
        emphasized leveraging resources available on darksky.org to find solutions and highlighted
        the historical contributions to astronomy, underscoring the responsibility to conserve night
        skies for future generations.
        Following Shweta's talk, a significant event took place where the Astroguide's batch in
        Manali was honored with certificates and recognized for the income they earned from their
        stargazing event. This event served as their graduation ceremony, marking the culmination of
        their training. The Astroguides introduced themselves and shared their experiences gained
        through the training program. They expressed heartfelt gratitude towards the AstronEra team
        for their support and guidance throughout the journey. This ceremony not only celebrated the
        achievements of the Astroguides but also highlighted the impact of empowering individuals
        with astronomical knowledge and skills for economic sustainability in the region.`,
