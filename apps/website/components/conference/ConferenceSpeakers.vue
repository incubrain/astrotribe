        usage efficiently and advocated for the adoption of lower-intensity lighting to
        minimize unnecessary illumination. Mrs. George emphasized the importance of
        properly aiming and shielding outdoor lights to prevent glare, light spill, and
        skyglow. Additionally, she recommended the implementation of louvers, baffles, or shields to
        direct light where needed and prevent it from dispersing into the sky or neighboring areas. To
        further mitigate light pollution, she suggested the use of curtains or blinds indoors to contain
        light within the premises, thus safeguarding the night environment from artificial light intrusion.
        
        Ms. George emphasized the importance of educating oneself and the community about the
        impacts of light pollution on the environment, human health, and astronomical observations.
        She encouraged support for organizations like the International Dark-sky Association (IDA),

        astronomical observations, particularly during twilight after dawn and dusk. She elucidated
        that the brightness of satellites depends on various factors, including inclination, altitude,
        attitude, orbital position, wavelength, and time of the year. Focusing on the Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST), which scans the skies for
        transients and near-Earth objects, Dr. Hasan discussed the adverse effects of satellite trails in
        science images. These effects encompass the loss of information on pixels, cross-talk in
        electronics, ghost images, and residual images, varying depending on the telescope and
        detector used. Furthermore, Dr. Hasan addressed potential solutions and mitigation strategies, referencing
        the SATCON1 report. These strategies include reducing reflectivity through the application of
        dark paint, redirecting light away, deploying fewer satellites to minimize the issue, designing
        smaller satellites to mitigate their impact, and ensuring predictability to facilitate scheduled observations

        educational and corporate settings. She provided a detailed account of her experiences while
        collaborating with the AstoTribe project in Nashik in 2022 and Ladakh in 2023. Ms Khade
        emphasized her work with tribal children who were undergoing training to become Astro
        guides. The incorporation of artistic elements proved instrumental in creating a comfortable
        environment, allowing the children to share their indigenous tribal stories related to
        constellations. This approach also facilitated discussions about the beliefs and superstitions
        prevalent in their respective tribal communities.

      title: 'Skill Training in Astronomy for Income Generation',
      description: `Shweta, the director of AstronEra and CEO of Astron
        SHK Trust, initiated the conference to bridge the link between conserving dark skies and
        sustainable socio-economic development. She introduced herself as an "AstroPreneur,"
        emphasizing her dual roles as a part-time astronomer and full-time entrepreneur. Shweta
        identified key problems including the lack of authentic astronomy knowledge, scientific
        temperament in society, and diminishing dark skies due to light pollution.
        She introduced the "AstroTribe" Project, funded by IAU and OAD, aimed at training tribal
        children in astronomy to empower them economically. This initiative incentivizes students by
        enabling them to generate income through bridging technical astronomy with entertainment
        through astrotourism, thereby promoting awareness about dark skies and addressing SDGs of
        quality education and sustainable economic growth.
        Shweta outlined action points post-conference, focusing on understanding the problem of
        light pollution, identifying target areas and audiences, determining mediums and expected
        outcomes, and establishing frameworks aligned with the human right to dark skies. She
        emphasized leveraging resources available on darksky.org to find solutions and highlighted
        the historical contributions to astronomy, underscoring the responsibility to conserve night
        skies for future generations.
        Following Shweta's talk, a significant event took place where the Astroguide's batch in
        Manali was honored with certificates and recognized for the income they earned from their
        stargazing event. This event served as their graduation ceremony, marking the culmination of
        their training. The Astroguides introduced themselves and shared their experiences gained
        through the training program. They expressed heartfelt gratitude towards the AstronEra team
        for their support and guidance throughout the journey. This ceremony not only celebrated the
        achievements of the Astroguides but also highlighted the impact of empowering individuals
        with astronomical knowledge and skills for economic sustainability in the region.`,
