## What are cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of text sent by your web browser by a website you visit. A cookie file is

## How AstronEra uses cookies

When you use and access the Service, we may place several cookies files in your web browser. We use

- **To provide analytics**: We use both session and persistent cookies on the Service and we use
  different types of cookies to run the Service, including:
  - **Essential cookies**: Necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off. They
    are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services,
    such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.
  - **Analytics and Performance cookies**: These allow us to recognize and count the number of
    visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us
