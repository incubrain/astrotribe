Ever wonder what it really takes to build satellites and shape the future of space? When we sat down with Joshua Miller, senior mechanical design engineer at Airbus Defense and Space, we couldn’t wait to hear his story of what goes on behind the scenes—and above our heads. Here’s a guy who turned a teenage apprenticeship into a role where he’s now leading projects, pushing boundaries, and helping build humanity’s connection to the cosmos.

**From Apprentice to Engineer Extraordinaire: Josh’s Journey.**
“So, Josh, tell us a little about your path. Was space always the goal?” we asked.
*"Funny enough, I didn’t start with a cosmic dream in mind,"* he laughed. *"I joined Airbus as an apprentice at 16, fresh out of school. It was a chance to learn. But soon, the work hooked me."* From completing his apprenticeship at 20 to earning a senior engineering role, Josh’s rapid growth came from a mix of determination, curiosity, and grit. 
Today, he oversees mechanical designs for satellite projects and manages a team—and he’s only just begun.
*"Space engineering isn’t about grand gestures but that daily grind, the push to innovate and refine,"* Josh shared. *"If I could name my mission, I'd call it **ENDEAVOR**. That’s what this career is, a constant endeavor.*
From his work on Airbus’s Digital Management System (DMS), which ensures smooth data flow across every stage of satellite creation, to his upcoming role in Assembly, Integration, and Testing, Josh sees space as a constant journey of learning, one problem at a time.

**Mission Passion: From Rock to Space Rock.**
Beyond the hard work, Josh knows how to balance his life with hobbies that keep him grounded. He’s a guitarist with a taste for David Bowie’s Space Oddity, a weightlifter, and a cook—all things that help him recharge. He smiled as he shared, *“If I went to space for a year, I’d bring three things: a photo of my girlfriend, my guitar, and a suit. I love to feel like myself, even in orbit!”*
He’s as fascinated with the future of space as he is with the daily work of getting there. *“If I had to pick one industry rule to change,” *he said,* “it would be our tracking and handling of space debris. The amount of old satellites floating up there is staggering, and we need better management of that to protect our skies.”*

**A Message to the Dreamers.**
“What would you say to the next generation of space engineers?” we asked as we wrapped up.
*“Keep that ambition alive. Dream big. Back in the ‘60s, no one knew if we’d put a man on the moon by decade’s end, but we did it. Aim for the moon, and if you miss, you just might land among the stars.”* Josh’s words are simple but powerful: space isn’t out of reach if you’re ready to reach for it.
As Josh reminded us, reaching for the stars doesn’t mean leaving who you are behind—it means taking your passions, quirks, and lessons learned right along with you. Josh’s journey is a powerful message to all of us that the universe is a little closer than we think. So, dream big, work hard, and who knows? You might just find yourself among the stars one day, too.

**Real Talk: Learning from Mistakes .**
“So, let’s be honest, what’s your biggest ‘oh-no’ moment?”
Josh chuckled, then leaned in.* “Well, early on as an apprentice, I made a rookie mistake: I agreed to a change with a client but didn’t_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __ __ _ _ __ __ _  __ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _ *
