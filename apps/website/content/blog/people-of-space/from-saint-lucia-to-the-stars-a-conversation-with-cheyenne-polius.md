**From Saint Lucia to the Stars: A Conversation with Cheyenne Polius**
How does a curious island girl from Saint Lucia evolve into a multi-hyphenate powerhouse—astrophysicist, data analyst, educator, founder, and advocate for women in STEM? Cheyenne Polius’s journey is a shining testament to dreaming big, embracing creativity, and the power of community. Let’s unpack her inspirational story from a recent interview that captured the essence of her stargazing mission.

**Curiosity Fueled by the Cosmos**
Cheyenne’s fascination with space sparked during childhood, fueled by an insatiable love for puzzles and documentaries. “_I remember watching space documentaries growing up_,” she says, recalling the awe that physics brought to her teenage years. By 15, her future was clear—she would unravel the mysteries of the universe as an astrophysicist.

Her journey wasn’t without challenges. Growing up in a small Caribbean nation, exposure to formal astronomy was minimal. “_I owe so much to my upbringing_,” Cheyenne reflects. “_But my path could have been completely different had I not stumbled on astrophysics through a Google rabbit hole_.”

**A Small Island Girl with Big Dreams**
Cheyenne’s roots in Saint Lucia taught her resilience and confidence. In an all-girls school environment, the narrative was empowering: girls excel academically and are future leaders. This culture fueled her confidence to pursue physics unapologetically. It’s no wonder her personal tagline is, “_A small island girl with big dreams._”

Despite limited exposure to space science on the island, Cheyenne forged her path, eventually relocating to the UK. But her connection to Saint Lucia remains strong, inspiring her community through her work and advocacy.

**Juggling Many Hats: How She Does It**
How does Cheyenne balance her roles as a data analyst, founder of the Saint Lucia National Astronomy Association (LUNA Journeys), and an advocate for women in STEM? “_One step at a time_,” she says. Her secret? A problem-solving mindset cultivated from physics and a deep passion for sharing science.

Cheyenne’s days are split between data-driven fintech projects and leading LUNA Journeys, her “_first child_.” LUNA aims to bring astronomy to Saint Lucia by hosting stargazing events and envisioning larger goals like a Caribbean space observatory and planetarium. “_I hope Luna outlives me_,” Cheyenne shares, emphasizing her commitment to creating a sustainable organization.

**STEM Advocacy with a Side of Creative Flair**
Cheyenne’s creativity doesn’t stop at science. She dreams of creating a space-themed children’s coloring book to spark young imaginations. “_Every child likes to color_,” she says, blending art and science into an accessible tool for STEM education.

This dual passion for outreach and innovation earned Cheyenne the prestigious STEM Advocate Award in 2022, a recognition that came at a pivotal moment. “_It was a reaffirmation that I was on the right path_,” she says. The accolade inspired her to scale her efforts and refine her vision.

**A Future as Bright as a Blue Star**
Cheyenne’s ambitions stretch far beyond her personal achievements. From dreaming of blue stars to envisioning a Caribbean empowered by space technology, her vision is expansive. “_I want the region to embrace how space research improves life on Earth—like climate action and sustainable development,_” she explains.

Her advice for aspiring scientists? “_Keep going. It’s not easy, but the challenges don’t mean you’re not meant for it. Passion and persistence will get you there._”

**Takeaway: Inspiration for the Next Generation**
Cheyenne’s story is a roadmap for any dreamer looking up at the stars. Her blend of intellect, creativity, and community spirit embodies the future of STEM—a field she continues to redefine.
