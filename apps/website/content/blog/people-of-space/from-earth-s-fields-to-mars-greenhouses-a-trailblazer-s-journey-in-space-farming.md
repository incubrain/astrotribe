Imagine asking your mom as a kid if you could become an astronaut and hearing, “_If you study hard, you can make it_.” Fast forward a few decades, and not only are you reaching for the stars, but you’re also planting seeds there—literally. Meet Mr. Davi Souza, a trailblazer in controlled environment agriculture and space farming, whose journey is rooted in humble beginnings on Earth but aimed squarely at the red planet.

**The Earthly Roots of Space Farming**
Davi’s path to space farming wasn’t planned—it sprouted organically. Growing up in Brazil’s countryside, farming was in his blood, but his childhood curiosity about space planted a seed of ambition. Encouraged by his mother, he pursued a technical course in electrical engineering and found his spark: a prototype for a smart greenhouse. This passion project became a stepping stone to his groundbreaking work in controlled environment agriculture (CEA).

His first big break came through Habitat Marte, South America’s first analog space station. Starting from scratch, Davi worked hands-on to turn an empty building into a thriving greenhouse. “_I learned how to cut pipes, connect systems, and create innovation from zero_,” he recalls. This practical experience laid the groundwork for his future ventures, both on Earth and in the cosmos.

**Controlled Environment Agriculture: From Theory to Practice**
CEA is more than just farming with a roof overhead. It’s a high-tech marvel where lighting, nutrients, and air are meticulously controlled to optimize plant growth. Davi explains that such systems are essential for farming in extreme environments—whether it’s the Brazilian semi-arid region, Saudi Arabian deserts, or the Martian surface.

For Mars, he envisions systems with artificial lighting, advanced nutrient delivery, and atmospheric management. The goal? To ensure that crops flourish even in the harshest conditions. “_Anything can become an innovation_,” Davi says, his excitement palpable.

**From Basil to Beer: A Love for Experimentation**
Of all the crops Davi has worked with, basil holds a special place in his heart. _“I grew basil, harvested it, and made pesto sauce—it was amazing to see a product through from seed to table_,” he shares. From leafy greens to hops for beer, his experiments highlight the versatility and potential of controlled farming systems. He dreams of growing coffee—because who wouldn’t want a fresh cup of Martian brew?

**Bridging Space and Earth**
Davi’s work isn’t just about growing plants in space—it’s about leveraging those innovations to solve Earthly challenges like food security and climate resilience. Extreme environments like deserts and urban centers provide valuable testbeds for technologies that could one day feed astronauts on Mars. As he points out, “_If we can grow food in space, we can grow it anywhere._”

This approach isn’t just theoretical. Davi has already introduced space farming concepts to Brazil’s first vertical and urban farm, demonstrating how these systems can thrive on Earth while paving the way for extraterrestrial agriculture.

**A Mission Beyond Mars**
Looking to the future, Davi dreams of managing a Martian greenhouse, but he’s just as committed to advancing terrestrial farming. His course, Space Farming 101, blends cutting-edge research with practical applications, making space farming accessible to professionals across industries.

His message to aspiring space farmers is clear: Start small, celebrate every win, and build a network. “_We aim for Mars, but we need to celebrate when we reach the Moon,_” he says, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging milestones on the journey to big goals.


Davi ’s story reminds us that innovation often starts with a single question and the courage to explore the unknown. Whether transforming Earth’s arid landscapes into fertile grounds or dreaming of growing basil on Mars, the possibilities are as endless as the cosmos itself.
