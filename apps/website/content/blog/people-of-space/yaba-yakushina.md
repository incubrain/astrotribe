**What if we told you the stars are vanishing—and it’s not just your city’s smoggy skyline to
blame?**

Meet Yana Yakushina: lawyer, researcher, educator, and the cosmic crusader leading a one-woman (but
not for long) legal rebellion against the modern world’s addiction to light.

In this radiant episode of _People of Space_ by Up, Yana plugs us into the lesser-known world of
space law—and flips the switch on light pollution. From arguing for dark skies at the UN to shaping
future policy through her PhD in Ghent, she's proving that lawyers can be stargazers too.

Let’s beam into the highlights.

### 🌟 “Remarkable.” The Word That Says It All.

That’s how Yana describes her journey. And honestly, we agree. Starting in Moscow, where the lights
never sleep, she moved to a sleepy, over-lit Belgian town that sparked her _lightbulb moment_: too
much light, even when no one's around. Why?

Naturally, she did what any space-savvy legal eagle would do—turned it into a mission.

> “Maybe I should be the first lawyer doing this stuff,” she said. And just like that, a career
> orbit was born.

### ⚖️ When Law Meets the Stars

So, how does space law connect to light pollution?

Here’s the Yana breakdown:

- As a **lawyer**, she shapes legal frameworks for dark sky protection.

- As a **researcher**, she digs into policy and environmental law.

- As an **educator**, she talks to literally everyone—from policymakers to citizens—about why the
  night matters.

Basically, if starlight had a legal team, Yana would be senior counsel.

### 🌍 From Ghent to the Galaxy: Why Light Pollution Isn’t Just an Astronomer’s Problem

Yana’s message is clear: light pollution isn’t just about seeing stars—it affects:

- **Human health**

- **Nocturnal wildlife**

- **Cultural heritage**

- And yes, our ability to stargaze without needing a spaceship.

And it's not just ground-based. Satellite constellations are turning Earth's orbit into a cosmic
Times Square.

### 🛰️ The Plan B Project: Light, Noise & a Lot of Science

Alongside her PhD, Yana coordinates _Plan B_—a powerhouse research project tackling how artificial
light and noise impact biodiversity. Think legal databases, urban planning tools, and even a
European light pollution map.

It's like SimCity, but for actual cities, and way more useful.

### 🦉 What Can _You_ Do (Other Than Panic)?

Yana’s advice:

- Recognize night as part of nature.

- Use warmer, directed lights.

- Install motion sensors. (Bonus: save on your energy bill.)

- Close your curtains. (Your neighbor's insomnia thanks you.)

- And most of all—_look up_.

Because once you’ve seen the Milky Way from La Palma (Yana’s top pick), you’ll never settle for LED
haze again.

### 💡 Favorite Moments?

Aside from swapping legal briefs for starry nights in La Palma and New Zealand, Yana’s favorite part
is the _people_—the global constellation of scientists, lawyers, artists, and citizens joining
forces to keep our skies dark and our minds blown.

> “People inspire me to do more,” she says. “And by meeting them, we keep getting more projects. The
> subject keeps growing.”

### 🚀 Final Orbit: Advice for Aspiring Space Law Warriors

“Now’s the time,” Yana says. The second space race is on, and space law is still catching up.

> "We need more specialists to help build the future framework—before it’s too late."

If you care about the stars, the species, or simply your sleep, maybe it's time you joined the
movement.

**One Last Thought:**

🌌 _What if your children never saw the stars?_

That’s not just poetic—it’s a very real possibility. But with champions like Yana leading the
charge, there's hope that our night skies won’t just be remembered—they’ll be _protected_.
