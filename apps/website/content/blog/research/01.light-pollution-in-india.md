title: The Impact of Light Pollution - A Call for Action in India and Beyond
description: >-
  Light pollution, the excessive or misdirected artificial light at night, is more than just a
  barrier to stargazing—it’s a growing environmental and health crisis. In India, a nation
  undergoing rapid urbanization, the effects of light pollution are becoming increasingly evident,
  yet the lack of localized research leaves us piecing together the puzzle with global data and
  logical estimates. This article delves into the stark realities of light pollution, presenting key
  statistics specific to India, followed by global estimates, to highlight the urgent need for
  change. We’ll also break down our research process, assumptions, and calculations, emphasizing the
  critical need for national-level studies in India to address this understudied issue.

## The Research Behind the Numbers: A Deep Dive

Light pollution’s impacts are profound, yet in India, the lack of comprehensive, country-specific
studies forces us to rely on global data, logical extrapolations, and localized insights where
available. Below, we detail the reasoning, calculations, and assumptions behind each statistic,
highlighting the gaps in Indian research and the urgent need for national-level studies.

### Population Living Under Light-Polluted Skies

- **India: ~80%**

  - **Reasoning:** Globally, 80% of the population lives under light-polluted skies, as reported by
    [DarkSky International](https://darksky.org/news/80-of-world-population-lives-under-skyglow-new-study-finds/)
    and a 2016 study in _Science Advances_ by Kyba et al.
    ([Artificially lit surface of Earth at night increasing in radiance and extent](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1701528)).
    This figure is based on satellite data showing skies brighter than natural by at least 10%.
    India, with its 37% urban population in 2025 (projected by the World Bank) and significant
    skyglow even in rural areas near cities, likely mirrors this global average. The absence of
    India-specific data led us to apply this percentage, assuming similar lighting practices in
    urban centers like Delhi and Mumbai.
  - **Assumptions:** We assumed that India’s urban-rural divide and lighting infrastructure align
    with global patterns, given the lack of localized studies.
  - **Need for Research:** India urgently needs national surveys to map light pollution levels,
    especially in rural areas where data is scarce.

- **Global: 80%**
  - **Reasoning:** The global figure is well-documented in the aforementioned _Science Advances_
    study, which used satellite imagery and ground measurements to confirm that 80% of the world’s
    population cannot see the Milky Way due to artificial skyglow.

### Annual Increase in Light Pollution

- **India: 7-10%**

  - **Reasoning:** A 2023 study in _Science_ by Kyba et al.
    ([Citizen scientists report global rapid reductions in the visibility of stars from 2011 to 2022](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq7781))
    found a global increase in sky brightness of 7-10% annually from 2011 to 2022, based on citizen
    science data. In India, rapid urbanization and the adoption of LED lighting exacerbate this
    trend. An article by _IndiaSpend_
    ([India Is Losing Its Night To Light, At 3 Times World Average](https://www.indiaspend.com/india-is-losing-its-night-to-light-at-3-times-world-average-44673))
    noted that the area under artificial light in India grew by a third from 2012 to 2016,
    translating to a 7.5% annual increase in lit area, likely correlating with brightness increases.
  - **Assumptions:** We assumed that brightness increases in India match the global range, given the
    lack of direct measurements, and factored in India’s faster urbanization rate compared to the
    global average.
  - **Need for Research:** India-specific studies on light pollution growth rates are virtually
    nonexistent, underscoring the need for longitudinal research to track this escalating issue.

- **Global: 7-10%**
  - **Reasoning:** The global estimate is directly from the 2023 _Science_ study, which highlights a
    faster increase than previously thought, driven by spectral changes in lighting (e.g., the shift
    to blue-rich LEDs).

### Annual Cost of Wasted Outdoor Lighting

- **India: ~$800 million**

  - **Reasoning:** To estimate this, we first calculated India’s energy consumption for street
    lighting. The Street Lighting National Programme (SLNP) installed 13 million LED street lights
    by 2017, saving 7.5 TWh annually
    ([Street lighting programme lights up 50,000 km of roads](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/street-lighting-programme-lights-up-50000-km-of-roads/articleshow/60136178.cms)).
    Assuming LEDs reduced consumption by 50%, total consumption is around 5 TWh. With 30% of outdoor
    lighting wasted (a figure consistent with the US, as per
    [DarkSky International](https://darksky.org/news/15-million-tons-of-carbon-dioxide-emitted-each-year-on-residential-outdoor-lighting-in-the-u-s/)),
    that’s 1.5 TWh wasted. At an average tariff of 7 INR per kWh (approximately $0.085), the cost is
    1.5 billion kWh \* $0.085 = $127.5 million for street lighting alone. Scaling this to include
    other outdoor lighting (e.g., commercial, residential), which could be 5-6 times higher based on
    global patterns, we arrive at approximately $800 million.
  - **Assumptions:** We assumed a 30% waste rate, similar to the US, and scaled street lighting
    costs to account for other outdoor lighting, given the lack of comprehensive Indian data.
  - **Need for Research:** India lacks detailed energy audits for outdoor lighting, making such
    estimates necessary but imprecise. National studies could provide accurate figures to drive
    policy changes.

- **Global: ~$16 billion**
  - **Reasoning:** The US figure of $3.3 billion, provided by
    [DarkSky International](https://darksky.org/news/15-million-tons-of-carbon-dioxide-emitted-each-year-on-residential-outdoor-lighting-in-the-u-s/),
    was scaled globally. Global electricity consumption is about 5.75 times that of the US (based on
    IEA data), but per capita lighting in developing regions is lower, so we adjusted to a factor of
    5, yielding $16 billion.
  - **Assumptions:** We assumed similar waste percentages globally, adjusted for economic
    disparities in lighting use.

### Higher Risk of Certain Health Issues

- **India and Global: 50% higher risk of breast cancer**
  - **Reasoning:** Studies like Stevens et al. (2010) in _Environmental Health Perspectives_
    ([LIGHT POLLUTION: Light at Night and Breast Cancer Risk Worldwide](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3002207/))
    found a 30-50% increased risk of breast cancer in regions with high light at night (LAN). A more
    recent study
    ([Study Links Artificial Light at Night and Cancer Risk](https://darksky.org/news/study-links-artificial-light-at-night-and-cancer-risk/))
    linked blue light exposure to a 1.5-times (50%) higher risk. This risk is relevant to India’s
    urban populations, where light pollution is rampant, though specific Indian studies are lacking.
  - **Assumptions:** We applied global health findings to India, assuming similar physiological
    responses to light exposure.
  - **Need for Research:** India needs epidemiological studies to assess light pollution’s health
    impacts, particularly in urban centers with high LAN exposure.

### Reduction in Activity for Nocturnal Animals

- **India and Global: 70% for many species**
  - **Reasoning:** Research on bats shows a 90% reduction in activity for clutter species under
    artificial light
    ([Adapting street lighting to limit light pollution’s impacts on bats](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351989421001980)),
    while moths experience a 52% reduction in caterpillar numbers under LED streetlights
    ([Why is light pollution bad for moths?](https://butterfly-conservation.org/news-and-blog/why-is-light-pollution-bad-for-moths)).
    Averaging these impacts across species like bats, moths, and other nocturnal animals, a 70%
    reduction is a reasonable estimate, applicable to India’s diverse ecosystems and globally.
  - **Assumptions:** We generalized species-specific data to “many nocturnal animals,” given the
    lack of comprehensive studies across all species.
  - **Need for Research:** India’s biodiversity hotspots, like the Western Ghats, require targeted
    studies to understand light pollution’s ecological impacts on local fauna.

## The Urgent Need for National-Level Research in India

The statistics above paint a grim picture, but they also reveal a critical gap: the lack of
India-specific research on light pollution. While global data provides a starting point, India’s
unique socio-economic context, rapid urbanization, and diverse ecosystems demand localized studies.
For instance, how does light pollution affect rural communities near urban centers? What are the
health impacts on India’s urban poor, who often live in brightly lit areas with little control over
their environment? How are India’s nocturnal species, from bats in the Himalayas to owls in the
Deccan, coping with artificial light?

National-level research could answer these questions, informing policies like better lighting
regulations, energy-efficient streetlight designs, and public awareness campaigns. Without such
data, India risks exacerbating the environmental, health, and economic toll of light pollution, all
while losing the cultural heritage of a star-filled sky.

## Conclusion: A Call to Action

Light pollution is a silent crisis, dimming our skies, harming our health, and disrupting
ecosystems. In India, the estimated $800 million in wasted lighting costs, the 50% higher breast
cancer risk, and the 70% reduction in nocturnal animal activity are wake-up calls. Globally, the $16
billion energy waste and similar health and ecological impacts underscore the scale of the problem.
But numbers alone don’t tell the full story—behind them lies a need for action, starting with
research. India must prioritize national studies to understand and mitigate light pollution’s
domestic impacts, ensuring a future where both people and nature can thrive under a truly dark sky.
