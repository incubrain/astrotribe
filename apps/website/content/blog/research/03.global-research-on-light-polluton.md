### Comprehensive Survey Note on Dark Sky Conservation Research Papers

This survey note provides a detailed examination of research papers on dark sky conservation,
focusing on light pollution's impacts and mitigation strategies. It encompasses a broad range of
studies, reflecting global efforts to address this environmental challenge, and includes insights
into institutional contributions, geographical origins, and key findings. The analysis is based on a
systematic review of available literature, highlighting six representative papers and
contextualizing them within the broader research landscape as of March 28, 2025.

#### Background and Scope

Dark sky conservation has emerged as a critical field, driven by the increasing prevalence of
artificial light at night (ALAN), which disrupts natural nocturnal environments. Light pollution,
encompassing sky glow, glare, light trespass, and clutter, affects astronomical observations,
wildlife behavior, human health, and energy consumption. The International Dark-Sky Association
(DarkSky International) and similar organizations have been pivotal in advancing research, with
annual reports summarizing scientific consensus, such as the 2023 "Artificial Light at Night: State
of the Science" report, which considered nearly 5,000 pieces of literature.

The research landscape is vast, with contributions from academic institutions, independent scholars,
and international collaborations. The Artificial Light At Night Research Literature Database, hosted
at [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2913367/alan_db/library), serves as a comprehensive
repository, searchable by keyword (e.g., sleep, birds, cancer), author, or publication, and is
freely accessible without login. This database, developed with the Loss of the Night Network,
underscores the global scale of research, with an average of 430 publications added annually,
reflecting a 22% yearly increase over the past two decades.

#### Methodology and Selection

The selection of papers for this survey involved identifying key studies through searches on
platforms like ResearchGate, Academia.edu, arXiv, and Annual Reviews, focusing on dark sky
conservation and related topics such as light pollution's ecological and health impacts. Keywords
included "dark sky conservation," "light pollution," and "artificial light at night," with an
emphasis on recent publications (post-2019) to capture current trends. The six papers chosen
illustrate diverse methodologies, from qualitative inquiries to AI-driven solutions, and represent
contributions from multiple countries and institutes.

#### Institutional and Geographical Insights

The papers reflect a global effort, with significant contributions from the USA (e.g., The Urban
Wildlands Group, Northeastern University), UK (e.g., University of Exeter, independent researcher
Ada Blair), Italy (Andrea Giacomelli), and Spain (Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia). The
involvement of independent researchers, such as Ada Blair, highlights the role of grassroots
efforts, while institutional research, like that from Northeastern University, underscores academic
leadership. The multi-country collaboration in Owens et al.'s work exemplifies the international
scope, though specific institutes were not detailed in the search results.

#### Key Findings and Implications

Each paper contributes unique insights:

- Blair's work explores the cultural and social significance of dark skies, emphasizing community
  engagement on Sark, a Dark Sky Island, and its implications for wellbeing.
- Longcore and Rich's seminal paper, "Ecological Light Pollution," distinguishes astronomical from
  ecological impacts, laying foundational research for subsequent studies, with 954 citations
  indicating its influence.
- Giacomelli's study from Italy highlights citizen science's role, particularly through the
  BuioMetria Partecipativa project, in raising awareness and collecting data, bridging research and
  public participation.
- Varshney et al.'s AI-driven approach at Northeastern University offers innovative solutions,
  predicting sky glow to inform mitigation strategies, reflecting technological advancements in the
  field.
- Gaston and SÃ¡nchez de Miguel's review, spanning UK and Spain, addresses LED technology's
  environmental costs, particularly blue wavelength emissions, and calls for adaptive lighting
  practices.
- Owens et al.'s paper identifies ALAN as a driver of insect declines, linking light pollution to
  food security and ecological health, with broad implications for conservation policies.

#### Broader Context and Resources

The research is part of a larger movement, with DarkSky International's annual reports, such as the
2023 report at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/8071915), synthesizing findings from thousands of
papers. The Globe at Night citizen-science campaign, accessible at
[Globe at Night](https://globeatnight.org/), further supports research by enabling public
participation in sky brightness measurements. The Lighting Issues Law Database, developed with the
University of Arizonaâs James E. Rogers College of Law, at
[University of Arizona](https://law.arizona.edu/news/2021/11/partnership-aims-combat-light-pollution-through-development-open-access-database),
provides legal perspectives, enhancing policy frameworks.

#### Limitations and Future Directions

While this survey captures a snapshot, the vastness of the field, with nearly 5,000 papers in the
ALAN database, suggests many more studies exist. The challenge lies in accessing and synthesizing
this volume, particularly for non-specialists. Future research could focus on integrating AI
solutions, as seen in Varshney et al., and expanding citizen science initiatives, as in Giacomelli's
work, to enhance global monitoring and mitigation efforts.

#### Conclusion

This survey note underscores the global and interdisciplinary nature of dark sky conservation
research, with key contributions from diverse institutes and countries. The selected papers
illustrate the field's breadth, from ecological impacts to technological innovations, and highlight
the need for continued collaboration to protect nocturnal environments. For further exploration, the
Artificial Light At Night Research Literature Database remains an invaluable resource, ensuring
researchers and policymakers can access the latest findings.
