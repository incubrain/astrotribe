  darker, higher-quality skies. A <i>descriptive flowchart</i> can help determine your
  area's Bortle class by guiding you through key observations. <br/> <br/>Since sky brightness can
  vary within a region, assessing multiple locations may provide a clearer picture.
  Steve Owens, a former member of the <i>Dark Sky Places Committee</i>, developed a

                  me? Well, as a firefly, I know the magic of natural light—I shine brightest when
                  the night is dark and calm. But with all the harsh artificial lights around, not
                  only are the stars disappearing, but it’s confusing creatures like me, disturbing

                  </h3>
                  <p class="pb-3 text-base font-normal">
                    Excessive and poorly managed outdoor lighting at night is a widespread issue,
                    often leading to unnecessary energy use, environmental harm, and increasing
                    light pollution. This growing problem can disrupt ecosystems and diminish
                    overall well-being. To address this, DarkSky and the Illuminating Engineering
                    Society have outlined the Five Principles for Responsible Outdoor Lighting,
                    offering practical guidance on minimizing light pollution through thoughtful
                    lighting design. Following these principles ensures outdoor lighting is
                    efficient, visually appealing, and environmentally conscious. Implementing them
                    can cut costs, conserve energy, and protect wildlife while maintaining effective
                    nighttime illumination.
