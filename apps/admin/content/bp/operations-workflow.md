### Business Operations and Workflow

1. **Day-to-Day Operations:**

   - **Content Writing:** Content will go through an automation process where an AI agent takes the
     content title, performs research on target keywords, aggregates top search results, formulates
     a draft post using SEO best practices and company-specific instructions, generates a featured
     image, and publishes it as a draft for review and finishing touches by our content team.
   - **Social Media Management:** Initially managed through platform-specific UI, with the potential
     to adopt third-party software or develop an in-house solution in the future.
   - **Customer Support:** Implement a ticketing system using our own database to track and
     prioritize inquiries.
   - **DevOps:** Automate infrastructure management and deployments using CI/CD pipelines.
   - **Technical Operations:** Use GitHub and GitHub Projects for project management, monitor
     feedback and metrics, and create prioritized tasks for development.
   - **Management:** Schedule regular strategy and performance review meetings to align operations
     with business goals.

2. **Workflow Processes:**

   - **Managing Content:** Implement a content management system (CMS) to streamline content
     creation, approval, and publishing. Include a rich text editor for users to manage content
     easily, changing status from Draft to Published when required.
   - **User Interaction:** Use analytics tools (e.g., PostHog) to track user behavior and feedback.
     Implement user feedback loops for continuous improvement.
   - **Technical Operations:** Use GitHub and GitHub Projects for project management, monitor
     feedback and metrics, and create prioritized tasks for development.

3. **Operational Goals:**
   - Achieve 10k Monthly Active Users (MAU) after 1 year, 50k MAU after 2 years.
   - End-to-end team support.
   - Scale operations by 50% Year Over Year (YOY).
   - Improve user-to-customer conversion rate by 100% from starting metrics.
   - Improve data processing rates and reduce technical and financial costs by 100%.
