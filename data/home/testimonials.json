    "quote": "Astronomy has always seemed beyond our reach. Not just because it studies the universe beyond the Earth's atmosphere, but because there are very few avenues for the ordinary citizens to study it. AstronEra is changing that. AstronEra is doing magical work. Scientifically. It is making Astronomy accessible, enjoyable and within reach for citizens around the world."

This is the feeling I got when I did my first ever star gazing with Shweta and AstronEra. Her spirit and passion to see beyond  our world, to explore the space is so contagious. Stay curious!"
