It marked the 10th hot fire in a 12-test series to certify production of new RS-25 engines by lead contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne, an L3 Harris Technologies company. The NASA Stennis test team fired the certification engine for 500 seconds, or the same amount of time engines must fire to help launch the SLS rocket to space with astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft. Operators powered the engine up to a level of 113%, which is beyond the 111% power level new RS-25 engines use to provide additional thrust. Testing up to the 113% power level provides a margin of operational safety. Newly produced engines will power NASA’s SLS rocket on Artemis missions to the Moon and beyond, beginning with Artemis V. For Artemis missions I-IV, NASA and Aerojet Rocketdyne modified 16 former space shuttle engines for use on the SLS rocket. Four RS-25 engines fire simultaneously to help launch each SLS rocket, producing up to 2 million pounds of combined thrust. Through Artemis, NASA will establish the foundation for long-term scientific exploration at the Moon, land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner astronaut on the lunar surface, and prepare for human expeditions to Mars for the benefit of all. RS-25 tests at NASA Stennis are conducted by a diverse team of operators from NASA, Aerojet Rocketdyne, and Syncom Space Services, prime contractor for site facilities and operations.'),

Why did you choose to work at NASA and how long have you worked here? I chose to work here at Armstrong because I needed a change – prior to getting a job here I was a Trust Operation Manager for a trust company and teleworking fulltime after moving to the area. Since I prefer in-person interaction, when I was offered a job as an Acquisition Specialist, I took it. From there another opportunity opened in the Flight Operations Directorate, where I was hired as a Flight Operations Scheduler. I’ve worked here at Armstrong for 13 years; 11 years as a contractor and 2 years as a Civil Servant. What has been your proudest accomplishment or highlight of your career? The highlight of my career is the NASA Honor Award for Exceptional Public Service that I received in 2020 for “Exceptional service as Flight Operations Scheduler”. Do you have any advice for others like yourself who may be contemplating a career at NASA? Go for it! I’ve enjoyed my time working at NASA and would always encourage people to apply for opportunities here when they’re available. What is the most exciting aspect of your job? In Flight Ops, the most exciting thing about my job, besides the people I get to interact with every day, is that we are part of all the flight missions that take place at Armstrong. From ground test to first flights and even last, we are involved in many different aspects. I have a unique job that allows us to not necessarily be tied to one mission or one project, but almost all of them, and that’s exciting. What did you want to be when you were growing up? Did you think you would ever work for NASA? I honestly didn’t have a solid plan – I remember telling people that my goal was to be happy and would find out what would bring me that happiness as I went through life. That eventually got me to NASA and I would say I’m pretty happy, so that’s a win. What’s the strangest tradition in your family? Or a unique family tradition? We have a tradition that if it’s your birthday, after we sing, we smear frosting on your face. The other traditional that isn’t strange, but I think is valuable is that we sit together for dinner as a family. If you could master a skill without any work, what would it be? I think mastering a musical instrument would be my choice – specifically the Cello. I can play basic chords on a Ukulele and Guitar, but I’m far from being a master, more like a beginner.

Common, harmless bacteria like Enterococcus faecalis (EF) and Enterococcus faecium, can be found on the International Space Station just as they are on Earth -- and yet, they exhibit resistance to antibiotics and are hardier than their counterparts down on the ground. This raises concerns about potential more harmful bacteria causing infections for astronauts, especially during long-duration missions, as standard antibiotic treatments might prove ineffective.To address this issue, Genomic Enumeration of Antibiotic Resistance in Space will survey the space station for antibiotic-resistant microbes. By analyzing the genetic makeup of these bacteria, scientists hope to understand how they adapt to the unique environment of space. This knowledge will be instrumental in developing protective measures for astronauts’ health on future long-duration missions. Additionally, it could contribute to a broader understanding of antibiotic resistance, benefiting healthcare practices on Earth.This is a medical illustration of vancomycin-resistant, Enterococci sp. bacteria, presented in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publication entitled, Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 (AR Threats Report).CDC/Jennifer OosthuizenCold Atom Lab Science Module - 1A temporary replacement module for the Cold Atom Lab will be aboard SpaceX-30.

During steel making processes, such as continuous casting, the impurity in the cast steel is influenced by the interplay between the molten steel and molten slags. Understanding the interfacial phenomena could help produce higher purity steels. Success could increase the space station''s commercial utilization and improve oxide melt manufacturing and application on Earth.Flow Boiling Condensation Module Power Filter Module (support hardware)During the initial checkouts following launch of the Condensation Module Power Filter hardware on NG-19 in August 2023, an anomaly was observed in the test section thermocouple readings.

The first used Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys to look at relatively nearby galaxies in an effort to build color versus brightness diagrams of the stars in these galaxies. Each observation only took one Hubble orbit (about 95 minutes) but provided a valuable archival record of the types of stars in different galaxies and therefore different environments.The second program used Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 to look at star clusters in dwarf galaxies. Their observations leveraged Hubble’s ultraviolet capabilities along with its ability to see fine details to better understand the environment where stars form in dwarf galaxies.

On Jan. 5, 1972, President Richard M. Nixon directed NASA to build the space shuttle, formally called the Space Transportation System (STS), stating that “it would revolutionize transportation into near space.” NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher hailed the President’s decision as “an historic step in the nation’s space program,” adding that it would change what humans can accomplish in space. Apollo 16 astronauts John W. Young and Charles M. Duke learned of the space shuttle’s approval while exploring the Moon in April 1972. Mission Control informed them that Congress had authorized the development of the space shuttle. Young and Duke both enthusiastically responded to the positive news with “Beautiful! Wonderful! Beautiful!” Young added with some foresight, “The country needs that shuttle mighty bad. You’ll see.” He had no way of knowing that nine years later, he would command the first ship of the space shuttle fleet, Columbia, on its maiden voyage.

Once Congress authorized the funds, on July 26, 1972, NASA awarded the contract to the North American Rockwell Corporation of Downey, California, to begin construction of the first orbital vehicle. Officially known as Orbital Vehicle-102 (OV-102), in January 1979 NASA named it Columbia after Captain Robert Gary’s sloop that explored the Pacific Northwest in the 1790s and took the honor as the first American ship to circumnavigate the globe, as well as after the Apollo 11 Command Module.

For the first step of the journey, workers towed Columbia from Palmdale overland to NASA’s Dryden, now Armstrong, Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base (AFB) 36 miles away. Two days later, workers there hoisted Columbia onto the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), a Boeing 747 aircraft modified to transport space shuttle orbiters. During a test flight, thousands of the orbiter’s thermal protection system tiles fell off. Workers returned Columbia to a hangar where over 100 men and women worked for nine days reapplying the tiles.

After arriving at the station, BurstCube will be unpacked and later released into orbit, where it will detect, locate, and study short gamma-ray bursts – brief flashes of high-energy light.“BurstCube may be small, but in addition to investigating these extreme events, it’s testing new technology and providing important experience for early career astronomers and aerospace engineers,” said Jeremy Perkins, BurstCube’s principal investigator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.The BurstCube satellite sits in its flight configuration in this photo taken in the Goddard CubeSat Lab in 2023.NASA/Sophia RobertsDownload high-resolution images and videos of BurstCube.Short gamma-ray bursts usually occur after the collisions of neutron stars, the superdense remnants of massive stars that exploded in supernovae. The neutron stars can also emit gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time, as they spiral together.Astronomers are interested in studying gamma-ray bursts using both light and gravitational waves because each can teach them about different aspects of the event. This approach is part of a new way of understanding the cosmos called multimessenger astronomy.The collisions that create short gamma-ray bursts also produce heavy elements like gold and iodine, an essential ingredient for life as we know it.Currently, the only joint observation of gravitational waves and light from the same event – called GW170817 – was in 2017. It was a watershed moment in multimessenger astronomy, and the scientific community has been hoping and preparing for additional concurrent discoveries since.“BurstCube’s detectors are angled to allow us to detect and localize events over a wide area of the sky,” said Israel Martinez, research scientist and BurstCube team member at the University of Maryland, College Park and Goddard. “Our current gamma-ray missions can only see about 70% of the sky at any moment because Earth blocks their view. Increasing our coverage with satellites like BurstCube improves the odds we’ll catch more bursts coincident with gravitational wave detections.”BurstCube’s main instrument detects gamma rays with energies ranging from 50,000 to 1 million electron volts. (For comparison, visible light ranges between 2 and 3 electron volts.)When a gamma ray enters one of BurstCube’s four detectors, it encounters a cesium iodide layer called a scintillator, which converts it into visible light. The light then enters another layer, an array of 116 silicon photomultipliers, that converts it into a pulse of electrons, which is what BurstCube measures. For each gamma ray, the team sees one pulse in the instrument readout that provides the precise arrival time and energy. The angled detectors inform the team of the general direction of the event.BurstCube belongs to a class of spacecraft called CubeSats. These small satellites come in a range of standard sizes based on a cube measuring 10 centimeters (3.9 inches) across. CubeSats provide cost-effective access to space to facilitate groundbreaking science, test new technologies, and help educate the next generation of scientists and engineers in mission development, construction, and testing.Engineers attach BurstCube to the platform of a thermal vacuum chamber at Goddard ahead of testing.NASA/Sophia Roberts“We were able to order many of BurstCube’s parts, like solar panels and other off-the-shelf components, which are becoming standardized for CubeSats,” said Julie Cox, a BurstCube mechanical engineer at Goddard. “That allowed us to focus on the mission’s novel aspects, like the made-in-house components and the instrument, which will demonstrate how a new generation of miniaturized gamma-ray detectors work in space.”BurstCube is led by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. It’s funded by the Science Mission Directorate’s Astrophysics Division at NASA Headquarters.

SpaceX’s Dragon resupply spacecraft, carrying more than 6,000 pounds of cargo to the orbiting laboratory, launched on the company’s Falcon 9 rocket at 4:55 p.m. EDT Thursday, from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The cargo spacecraft is scheduled to autonomously dock at the space station on Saturday, March 23, at approximately 7:30 a.m. and remain at the orbital outpost for about a month. Live coverage of the arrival will begin at 5:30 a.m. on NASA+, NASA Television, and on the agency’s website. Learn how to stream NASA TV through a variety of platforms. The Dragon will deliver a new set of sensors for Astrobee robots to support automated 3D sensing, mapping, and situational awareness functions. These systems could support future Gateway and lunar surface missions by providing automated maintenance and surface scanning using rovers. Additionally, the spacecraft will deliver BurstCube, a small satellite that is designed to study gamma-ray bursts that occur when two neutron stars collide. This satellite could widen our coverage of the gamma-ray sky, improving our chances of studying bursts both with light and gravitational waves, or ripples in space-time, detected by ground-based observatories. Finally, the spacecraft also will deliver sampling hardware for Genomic Enumeration of Antibiotic Resistance in Space (GEARS), an initiative that will test different locations of the space station for antibiotic-resistant microbes. In-flight gene sequencing could show how these bacteria adapt to the space environment, providing knowledge that informs measures to protect astronauts on future long-duration missions. These are just a few of the hundreds of investigations conducted aboard the orbiting laboratory in the areas of biology and biotechnology, physical sciences, and Earth and space science. Advances from this scientific research will help keep astronauts healthy during long-duration space travel and demonstrate technologies for future human and robotic exploration beyond low Earth orbit to the Moon through NASA’s Artemis campaign, in advance of the first crewed mission to Mars.

NASA/Sam Lott A test version of the SLS (Space Launch System) rocket’s payload adapter is ready for evaluation, marking a critical milestone on the journey to the hardware’s debut on NASA’s Artemis IV mission. Comprised of two metal rings and eight composite panels, the cone-shaped payload adapter will be part of the SLS Block 1B configuration and housed inside the universal stage adapter atop the rocket’s more powerful in-space stage, called the exploration upper stage. The payload adapter is an evolution from the Orion stage adapter used in the Block 1 configuration of the first three Artemis missions that sits at the topmost portion of the rocket and helps connect the rocket and spacecraft. “Like the Orion stage adapter and the launch vehicle stage adapter used for the first three SLS flights, the payload adapter for the evolved SLS Block 1B configuration is fully manufactured and tested at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama,” said Casey Wolfe, assistant branch chief for the advanced manufacturing branch at Marshall. “Marshall’s automated fiber placement and large-scale integration facilities provide our teams the ability to build composite hardware elements for multiple Artemis missions in parallel, allowing for cost and schedule savings.” Teams at Marshall manufactured, prepared, and move the payload adapter test article.

NASA 1234 At about 8.5 feet tall, the payload adapter’s eight composite sandwich panels, which measure about 12 feet each in length, contain a metallic honeycomb-style structure at their thickest point but taper to a single carbon fiber layer at each end. The panels are pieced together using a high-precision process called determinant assembly, in which each component is designed to fit securely in a specific place, like puzzle pieces. After manufacturing, the payload adapter will also be structurally tested at Marshall, which manages the SLS Program. The first structural test series begins this spring. Test teams will use the engineering development unit – an exact replica of the flight version of the hardware – to check the structure’s strength and durability by twisting, shaking, and applying extreme pressure. While every Block 1B configuration of the SLS rocket will use a payload adapter, each will be customized to fit the mission’s needs. The determinant assembly method and digital tooling ensure a more efficient and uniform manufacturing process, regardless of the mission profile, to ensure hardware remains on schedule. Data from this test series will further inform design and manufacturing processes as teams begin manufacturing the qualification and flight hardware for Artemis IV. NASA is working to land the first woman, first person of color, and its first international partner astronaut on the Moon under Artemis. SLS is part of NASA’s backbone for deep space exploration, along with the Orion spacecraft and Gateway in orbit around the Moon and commercial human landing systems, next-generational spacesuits, and rovers on the lunar surface. SLS is the only rocket that can send Orion, astronauts, and supplies to the Moon in a single launch.

The human cardiovascular system, which includes the heart and blood vessels, has evolved to operate in Earth’s gravity. When astronauts travel to space, their bodies begin to adjust to the microgravity of their spacecraft. Blood and other bodily fluids previously pulled downward by gravity now move toward the head, so the cardiovascular system doesn’t have to work as hard to maintain blood flow to the brain. This adaptation to weightlessness can result in reduced blood volume and reduced function of the heart and blood vessels. When astronauts return to Earth, gravity once again pulls their body fluids downward. The cardiovascular system is now challenged to regulate blood pressure, causing some astronauts to feel weak, dizzy, or faint when they stand immediately upon arrival on Earth. These symptoms can last for a few days until they get used to spending time back in Earth’s gravity. What we learn while aboard the space station has important applications on Earth. Many of the changes seen in space resemble those caused by aging on Earth. As we age, particularly if we don’t remain physically active, the efficiency of the heart and blood vessels to maintain blood pressure while standing may decrease and some people may develop heart disease. Because spending time in space affects the heart and circulatory system, research on the space station looks at these effects in both the short and long term. Research aims to develop and test countermeasures to cardiovascular adaptations to spaceflight to benefit both astronauts and people on the ground. Below are some examples of studies performed on the station involving cardiovascular research. NASA astronaut Jessica Meir conducts EHT-2 in the Life Sciences Glovebox aboard the space station. NASA Monitor Fluids Shifting Using 3D ultrasound technology, Vascular Echo, an investigation from CSA (Canadian Space Agency), examined changes in blood vessels and the hearts of crew members in space and followed their recovery upon return to Earth. 3D images of blood vessels using ultrasounds show more detail than 2D images, just like how a model car is a better representation than a flat picture of that car. Astronauts used a motorized ultrasound probe to scan crucial body parts. Meanwhile on the ground, scientists could adjust the angle of the ultrasound beam emitted by the probe to collect the best image possible. Using this technology allowed crews to collect high-quality scans even though they’re not necessarily expert sonographers.1 An investigation called Fluid Shifts demonstrated how much fluid—including water and blood—moves from the lower body to the upper body in space. The study also evaluated the impact these shifts have on the structure and function of the eyes and brain. Results showed that several measurements of body fluids shifting towards the upper body were elevated during spaceflight but were reduced to preflight levels when using methods to reverse these fluid shifts.2 Canadian Space Agency (CSA) astronaut David Saint-Jacques performs an ultrasound for Vascular Echo which study the effects of weightlessness on astronauts’ blood vessels and hearts. Canadian Space Agency/NASA Culturing Stem Cells An investigation completed in 2018, Cardiac Myocytes examined how stem cells differentiate into specialized heart cells (cardiac myocytes). The experiment evaluated cell maturation in microgravity and tested the ability of the cells to repair damaged heart tissues. This study advances the development of possible regenerative therapies for both astronauts and patients on Earth. Subsequent experiments took advantage of microgravity’s effects on cell behavior and growth to create tools for further research, model disease, and test potential treatments for heart damage. MVP Cell-03 examined whether microgravity increased production of heart cells from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Pluripotent cells have started to differentiate, making them more specialized than stem cells, but they retain the ability to develop into multiple types of cells. Any observed increase in production of heart cells could make it possible to use cultured cells to help treat spaceflight-induced cardiac abnormalities and create personalized therapies to replenish heart cells damaged or lost due to disease on Earth. Project EAGLE, a related experiment, grows 3D cultures of heart cells in microgravity and could provide a heart tissue model that mimics heart disease and assesses potential drug therapies. Beating cardiac spheres produced from cells cultured on the space station for the MVP Cell-03 investigation. Emory University School of Medicine Tiny Organ-like Devices Many studies aboard the space station use tissue chips, small devices that mimic functions of human organs. These tools include 3D cultures of specific cell types, tissues engineered to reproduce specific cellular characteristics, as well as 3D structures made from many different cell types in a particular organ such as the heart. These stand-ins for actual hearts enable new types of research and drug testing. Engineered Heart Tissues (EHT) used 3D tissues derived from hiPSCs to study cardiac function in microgravity. A magnet-based sensor underneath the culture chamber allowed real-time, non-destructive analysis of the functional performance and maturation of the tissues in space. Engineered Heart Tissues-2 builds on its predecessor using 3D cultures of cardiac muscle tissue to test therapies that may prevent these changes. Cardinal Heart, a study using engineered heart tissues to understand effects of change in gravitational force on cardiovascular cells, confirmed that microgravity exposure causes significant changes in heart cell function and gene expression that could lead to damage.3 Cardinal Heart 2.0 took this research to the next level. It used a beating heart organoid containing different kinds of stem-cell-derived cardiac cells to test whether certain drugs can reduce or prevent microgravity-induced changes. Using tissue chips to test new drugs could help reduce the need for the animal studies required before clinical trials in humans, potentially shortening the time between the discovery of a drug candidate and its clinical use. This biocell contains beating cardiac spheroids derived from iPSCs. Stanford Cardiovascular Institute.

Early Career Community Nurtures Development of NASA’s Future Discipline Leaders NASA has acknowledged the need for “attracting and advancing a highly skilled, competent, and diverse workforce in order to cultivate an innovative work environment…” as stated in Objective 3.1 of the 2014 NASA Strategic Plan. A survey conducted in 2014 by Emerge, the early-career professional group at JSC, showed that recent hires believe that “communication and collaboration amongst organizations” is a key area of improvement, while “lack of opportunities for professional growth” is the top reason why they would consider leaving the Agency. This, when coupled with NASA’s aging workforce (the average age as of 2016 was 49), stresses the importance of capturing knowledge to pass along to the next generation of NASA engineers. The Structures, Loads and Dynamics, Mechanical Systems, and Materials (SLAMMS) disciplines have also been identified as critical fields for the advancement of NASA’s strategic vision, which emphasizes the importance of developing and retaining engineers in those areas. Consequently, the SLAM(M)S Steering Committee (Materials was not initially included), comprising center SLAMS Division/Branch Chiefs and NASA Technical Fellows, formed the Young Professionals Forum in 2012, which evolved into the current Early Career Forum (ECF) in 2017, and was expanded to provide year-round activities (e.g., monthly meetings, training opportunities) for the Early Career Community (ECC). Over the lifetime of the ECC, the SLAMS Steering Committee was dissolved, and the stewardship of the ECC relied on the Technical Fellows, who empowered ECC leaders to take on the primary responsibility of planning and running the ECC and ECF events. Today’s SLAMMS Early Career Community Within the past few years, a new SLAMMS Division/Branch Chief collaboration group was formed, called the SLAMMS Leadership Working Group (LWG), and is led by James Loughlin, GSFC Mechanical Systems Division Chief, with co-lead Elonso Rayos, JSC Structures Engineering Assistant Division Chief. The LWG is a forum focused on capability sustainment, discipline technical challenges, and workforce concerns. For example, disparate Agency technical resource access is discussed, collaboration is coordinated, and critical gaps in expertise are filled using cross-Agency cooperation. The current SLAMMS ECE leadership team includes Khadijah Shariff (JSC-Structures), Dr. Matthew Chamberlain (LaRC- Loads & Dynamics), Dr. Jonathan Sauder (JPL-Mechanical Systems), and Cassie Smith (JPL-Mechanical Systems). NASA Technical Fellows supporting SLAMMS are Deneen Taylor (Structures), Dr. Dexter Johnson (Loads & Dynamics), Dr. Michael Dube (Mechanical Systems), and Dr. Bryan McEnerney (Materials). The SLAMMS Early Career Forum The ECF is the annual “face-to-face” workshop for the community. The ECF is held at a different NASA center each year and features technical presentations by early career engineers (ECE), splinter sessions with NASA Technical Fellows, mentor presentations, facility tours, networking events, design challenges, and evening social activities to advance the SLAMMS disciplines and develop NASA’s future workforce. The ECF features technical presentations given by the ECEs to their peers, senior engineers, and Technical Fellows. The 12th Annual SLAMMS ECF was held at MSFC and virtually. Sixty-six ECEs, Technical Fellows, TDT mentors, and discipline managers from the SLAMMS LWG were in attendance. ECEs from 8 centers made 16 technical presentations and 18 posters, which were ranked by mentors for the top awards. Multiple splinter sessions provided ECEs with opportunities to ask career-related advice from Technical Fellows, project and systems management, and individuals experienced in design, analysis, and testing. In addition, there was a detailed discussion for each of the technical disciplines represented at the forum, and multiple site tours were provided. Attendees of the 12th annual SLAMMS EFC at MSFC 2023. The Future of the SLAMMS ECC The SLAMMS ECC will continue to evolve as discussions with the ECE leadership team and Technical Fellows continue towards mapping its future. SLAMMS is igniting cross-Agency collaboration for future generations. Its current goals include communication and collaboration among organizations, professional growth of early career engineers, knowledge capturing for the next generation of NASA engineers, and developing and retaining engineers in the specific SLAMMS disciplines. It will nurture the technical, professional, and personal development of NASA’s next generation of SLAMMS discipline leaders. Awards presented by Dr. Dexter Johnson.

Updating Guidance on Shock Qualification and Acceptance Test Requirements The L&D TDT has completed work that will have a positive impact on shock testing of NASA flight hardware. Pyroshock is the transient response of a structure to loading induced by activation of attached or incorporated pyrotechnic devices. Typical pyrotechnic devices include frangible bolts, separation nuts, and pin pullers that are used to assemble, separate, and reconfigure spaceflight hardware during a mission. Shocks can easily propagate through structure and damage sensitive components. Thus, successful pyroshock testing is considered essential to mission success. At the request of the Gateway Program Chief Engineer, the NASA Chief Engineer initiated an inquiry to reevaluate shock testing approaches for both unit and major assembly flight hardware and requested recommendations for potential revisions to NASA-STD-7003B, Pyroshock Test Criteria, that would clarify the guidance and applicability to new programs. The work delves into topics of shock acceptance and qualification testing for unit and major assemblies, shock test tolerances, shaker shock testing, and the distinction between mechanical shock and pyroshock testing. It also provides recommendations for their inclusion in the next Agency-wide revision of NASA-STD-7003B. Current NASA-STD-7003B Requirements Unit and major assembly flight hardware acceptance and qualification testing are discussed in NASA-STD-7003B. It requires that all units go through shock qualification testing, with few exceptions. The purpose of a qualification test is to verify the design integrity of the flight hardware. The standard calls for pyroshock qualification testing of nonflight hardware for externally induced environments to be performed with a 3 dB margin added to the maximum predicted environment (MPE), with two shocks per each orthogonal axis. Qualification tests are performed on hardware that will not be flown but is manufactured using the same drawings, materials, tooling, processes, inspection methods, and personnel competency as used for the flight hardware. The flight hardware is not recommended to go through shock test, therefore, it lacks workmanship screening testing. The required random vibration (RV) test is considered to be a partial workmanship screening, covering only up to 2000 Hz. A full workmanship screening test for unique and sensitive hardware that may have modes above 2000 Hz needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by an expert in pyroshock dynamics and approved within a program’s risk management system and/or governing board. The major assembly acceptance and qualification testing are not recommended, considering that the MPE and design margin cannot be demonstrated at the system-level tests. The major assembly unmargined testing, however, may achieve three objectives. First, the functional demonstration of shock separation devices—probably the most important part of the major assembly level testing—demonstrates the source electrical and mechanical hardware functions as expected, and the interface separates without any issues. Second, the major assembly testing provides the validation of the unit shock environments. Third, the major assembly testing provides transfer functions (TF) that may help to estimate the attenuation—and in some cases structural amplifications—throughout the system with all assemblies in flight configuration. NASA-STD-7003B contains discussions for the first two major assembly test objectives. However, there are no discussions on the third test objective related to the TFs. The TFs provide qualitative assessment of shock propagation paths and attenuations at joints and interfaces. The TFs may be used qualitatively as attenuation is highly dependent on the materials and joint construction and may be different if there are changes in the system configuration. Suggestions for Improving NASA-STD-7003B The shock tolerance specified in NASA-STD-7003B is ±6 dB from 100 Hz to 3 kHz and +9/-6 dB above 3 kHz. The constant ±6 dB tolerance bandwidths across all frequencies are possible, as many existing shock simulation systems are able to simulate shock signatures that fall within these tolerances without difficulty. These tolerances are based on practical test implementation and shock simulation equipment consideration. The tolerance tightening should be considered at the flight hardware resonant frequencies to avoid over/under testing. However, if detonator or explosive shock simulation systems are used to qualify flight hardware, the shock tolerances above 3 kHz may be kept at +9/-6 dB. Measurements from many different pyro/non-pyro separation systems have been shown to have broader shock signatures and do not support the mechanical shock as being applicable to low- and mid-frequency shocks only. The standard discusses this topic and has an example of far field SRS indicating shock energy above 2 kHz. The future revision should clarify the applicability of the mechanical shocks to be broader and not to be limited to 2 kHz and below (see figure below). An example shock response spectrum (SRS) obtained from a mechanical shock separation system, indicating a broad signature is produced by pyro devices. The Gateway Program has benefitted from the updated guidance recommended for NASA-STD-7003B. Even though shaker shock testing has been used in the past and is still used by some NASA organizations and contractors, there are multiple technical issues with this type of testing. The shaker-generated shock signatures in the low- and mid-frequency range (typically up to ~2 kHz) provide severe shock environments that may lead to structural failures. Most shakers are also not able to generate SRS above ~2 kHz, therefore, shaker shock test is deficient in meeting the shock requirement up to 10 kHz frequency. NASA-STD-7003B does not recommend the shaker method of shock testing due to the above limitations. This should be emphasized more in the standard. The shaker shock simulation test may be used if it is able to generate time histories that resemble signatures generated by space separation devices, and SRS levels meet the entire frequency range requirements. For the next NASA-STD-7003B revision, recommendations are being made to include acceptance RV testing for partial workmanship screening testing, add the TFs to be used as qualitative information in assessing the attenuation in the structural shock paths, change the shock tolerance to ±6 dB across all frequencies, and consider mechanical shocks to be broader and not limited to low- and mid-frequency SRSs. In summary, the updated guidance provides clarification to the question/uncertainty of the applicability of historical guidance to current programs, while ensuring proper applicability to future programs. This work directly benefitted the Gateway Program, and could potentially benefit the Human Lander System (HLS).

Kenny, who was less than two years into his NASA career, had the opportunity to see the liftoff from Launch Pad 39A as part of receiving the Space Flight Awareness Award for supporting the Space Shuttle Program’s solid rocket booster flight program. “That was the first launch I ever witnessed in person,” said Kenny, whose inspiration for working at NASA came from watching televised shuttle launches as a youth. “It was amazing and made me appreciate how such a powerful system could be designed and flown so successfully.” Jeremy Kenny, manager of NASA’s Cryogenic Fluid Management Portfolio Project, holds a model spacecraft for the proposed large cryogenic demonstration mission.

Kenny was selected to lead the SLS Modal Acoustic Test program, which helped engineers understand how loud the rocket would be during liftoff. He later joined another key Artemis effort, the Human Landing System program, as a technical manager, overseeing the development of lander systems that will transport astronauts to the Moon’s surface. “Artemis is an inspiring campaign for future human spaceflight exploration,” Kenny said. “I worked with SLS, Orion, and Exploration Ground Systems, and it was very fulfilling to see all the pieces come together for the successful Artemis I launch.” In January, Kenny was named manager of NASA’s Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) Portfolio project, where he oversees a cross-agency team based at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, and Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. The CFM portfolio includes innovative technologies to store, transfer, and measure ultra-cold fluids – such as liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, and liquid methane. These cryogens are the most common propellants in space exploration, making CFM integral to NASA’s future exploration and science efforts. “We must mature CFM technologies to support future flight mission architectures,” said Kenny. “The strong partnership between Marshall and Glenn in CFM maturation continues to produce excellent results, enabling in-space cryogenic systems vital to NASA’s Moon to Mars vision.” Kenny’s choice of profession comes as little surprise, given his family background. He had a grandfather and an uncle who worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the family’s hometown of Vicksburg, Mississippi. From them, Kenny learned how math and physics could be implemented in real-world applications. He earned three degrees in mechanical engineering: a bachelor’s from Mississippi State University in Starkville, a master’s from Georgia Tech in Atlanta, and a doctorate from the University of Alabama in Huntsville. “My grandfather showed me various engineering software programs he worked on to simulate ground terrains for military transportation systems,” Kenny said. “My uncle worked on engineering developments for various military systems; he was a key influence for me to pursue graduate degrees in mechanical engineering.” When Kenny’s not working to evolve technology for NASA’s future deep space exploration missions, he’s spending time with his wife and their two daughters, who are involved in choir and dance. “Watching them practice and perform inspires me,” Kenny said with a smile. “My biggest challenge is balancing my professional work, which I love, and spending time with my family, who I love. With work comes many exciting opportunities, and solving hard problems is fun. But that excitement should not detract from keeping your personal relationships healthy. One day, I’ll retire and spend all my free time with family.” The CFM Portfolio Project’s work is under NASA’s Technology Demonstration Missions Program, part of NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, which oversees a broad portfolio of technology development and demonstration projects across NASA centers and American industry partners.

The NESC Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), Crew Systems, and Extravehicular Activity (EVA) discipline is led by the NASA Technical Fellow for ECLS, Dr. Morgan Abney, ECLSS & Crew Systems Deputy Dave Williams, Extravehicular & Human Surface Mobility Deputy Danielle Morris, and EVA Deputy Colin Campbell. In 2023, this team led assessments and provided support to the Commercial Crew Program, ISS, Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, Extravehicular and Human Mobility Program, Gateway International Habitat, and Moon-to-Mars Program. Three of the most notable activities in 2023 are briefly described below. Mitigation for Water in the Helmet During EVA During EVA22 in 2013, water was observed in the helmet and assumed to be the result of a “burp” from the drink bag. No further investigation was pursued because water had been observed to some degree (water on visor, wet hair, etc.) on eight previous occasions. The result was a nearly catastrophic event during EVA23, where astronaut Luca Parmitano experienced dangerous quantities of water in his helmet. Both EVA23 and EVA35 in 2016 contributed to identification of drowning as a key risk, which resulted in several water mitigation approaches. Based on these approaches, the program determined the risk level to be acceptable for nominal EVA. However, in March 2022, a crewmember returning from EVA80 noticed water accumulated on the visor of his helmet obstructing ~30-50% of his field of view. Due to the increasing complexity of EVA objectives on EVA80 and forward, the ISS Program identified loss or reduction of visibility as a greater risk than previously recognized and sought to identify methods to prevent even small quantities of liquid water from forming in the helmet during EVA. The NESC was asked to provide support to the activity through modeling of the helmet and two-phase (water and oxygen) flow behavior in microgravity, through model validation testing, and through testing of mitigation hardware identified by the larger team. The model predictions provided a map (Figure 1) of anticipated liquid water formations based on the contact angle between the face or head and the helmet surface. Based on the ISS helmet with no water mitigations, the model predicted that large blobs would most likely form bridges between the helmet and face and that rupture of those bridges would result in the majority of liquid transferring to the face. To mitigate this risk, the ISS EVA80 team devised a solution to add absorbent materials in the path of the oxygen and water entering the helmet. Following EVA23, the helmet absorption pad (HAP) was added for bulk water collection. The improved mitigation strategy based on EVA80 included a HAP extender (HAP-E) and a helmet absorption band (HAB) (Figure 2). The NESC provided modeling of the mitigation hardware and validation testing of the HAB configuration using flow conditions anticipated in ISS operation (Figure 3). The testing provided ground validation of the HAB performance. The HAB and HAP-E have both been implemented in flight. Figure 1. Map of predicted water formations within a helmet as a function of face/head and helmet contact angles. Dashed rectangle indicates the expected domain of the ISS helmet with no water mitigations.

HAB ground validation testing under trickle water flow conditions. Evaluation of Terrestrial Portable Fire Extinguishers for Microgravity Applications The tragic fire of Apollo 1 has, of necessity, instilled in NASA an enduring respect for the risk of fire in spacecraft. As such, robust fire detection and response systems have been a cornerstone of NASA-designed vehicles. Portable fire extinguishers (PFE) are a fundamental fire response capability of spacecraft and both carbon dioxide and water-based PFEs have been used by NASA historically. However, terrestrial-based PFEs, particularly those using new halon-based suppressants, may provide improved capability beyond the NASA state-of-the-art. In 2023, the NESC sought to evaluate the effectiveness of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) PFEs in microgravity. The team developed an analytical model to predict the discharge rate of three terrestrial COTS PFEs containing CO2, HFC-227ea, and Novec 1230. The model considered the internal geometry of the PFEs, the material properties of the suppressants and their corresponding PFE tanks, and the effects of microgravity and in-flight perturbations. The results predicted that for PFE tanks containing dip tubes, like those for HFC-227ea and Novec 1230 where nitrogen gas is used as a pressurant, microgravity plays a significant role in the discharge performance due to two-phase flow. Figure 4 shows the various equilibrium configurations based on gravity and perturbations. As a comparison, the analysis predicts >80% discharge of the HFC-227ea in the COTS PFE within ~30 seconds with the remainder discharging over ~0.5-1 hours when discharged in a terrestrial fire (Figure 4A), while only 60-80% discharges in 30 seconds with the remainder discharging over 1-2 hours in microgravity (Figure 4C). Figure 4. Equilibrium two-phase configurations of nitrogen (white)-pressurized liquid suppressant (blue). A) PFE held nominally with nozzle up in 1-g with no perturbations, B) PFE held inverted in 1-g or in 0-g where liquid preferentially accumulates away from the dip tube entrance with no perturbations, C) PFE in 0-g at the statistically most probable state with no perturbations, D) PFE in 0-g where nitrogen preferentially accumulates at ends of the PFE with no perturbations, E) PFE in any level gravity with significant perturbations (shaken up), and F) statistically most probable state in 0-g following complete discharge. Based on this analysis, the use of terrestrially designed PFEs containing gaseous pressurant over a liquid suppressant will likely result in decreased initial discharge of the suppressant and significantly longer total discharge times in microgravity as compared to terrestrial discharge performance. Testing is ongoing to validate the models using a custom-designed PFE test stand (Figures 5 and 6) that enables multi-configuration testing of COTS PFEs. Figure 5. (left) PFE test stand for model validation. Design prevents directional load effects to enable accurate mass measurement during PFE discharge. Figure 6. (right) Insulated PFE housing and remote discharge control allows for accurate, real-time thermal measurements during validation testing. Standardized Abrasion, Cut, and Thermal Testing for Spacesuit Gloves and Materials State-of-the-art spacesuit gloves have been optimized for the challenges of ISS. Artemis missions call for high-frequency EVAs at the lunar south pole, where temperatures in the permanently shadowed region (PSR) will expose crew gloves to temperatures lower than ever previously experienced and where frequent and repeated exposure to regolith dust and rocks will present significantly increased risk for abrasion and cuts. With the development of new spacesuits by commercial partners, inexpensive and repeatable test methods are needed to characterize, evaluate, and compare gloves and glove materials for their thermal performance at PSR temperatures and for their resistance to lunar regolith abrasion and cuts. To address these needs, the NESC is leading a team to develop standardized test methods in coordination with ASTM International Committee F47 on Commercial Spaceflight. Three standardized methods are currently in development. The first method seeks to standardize lunar dust abrasion testing of glove (and suit) materials based on adapted “tumble testing” first proposed at NASA in 1990. The NASA-designed tumbler (Figure 7) enables testing of six samples per run and compares pre- and post-tumbled tensile strength of materials to compare abrasion resistance. The method is highly controlled using a commercially available tumble medium and lunar regolith simulant. Because material properties change with temperature, the second method seeks to develop a standardized approach to evaluate the cut resistance of glove materials at relevant cryogenic temperatures. The method is an adaptation of ASTM F2992 Standard Test Method for Measuring Cut Resistance of Materials Used in Protective Clothing with Tomodynamometer (TDM-100) Test Equipment. In order to allow for cut evaluation at cryogenic temperatures, the TDM-100 cut fixture was modified to include channels for liquid nitrogen flow (Figure 8A), thereby cooling the test material to 77 K. Figure 7. Hardware used in the tumble test method. Tumbler apparatus (left). Tumbler with panel removed to show lunar regolith simulant and commercially available tumbler media (top right). Tumbler panel showing lunar regolith simulant (bottom right). The third method seeks to evaluate the thermal performance of gloves down to PSR requirement temperature of 48 K. Historical thermal testing of gloves was conducted with human-in-the-loop (HITL) testing for both radiative and conductive cooling. Conductive cooling was accomplished by having the test subject grab thermally controlled “grasp objects” and maintain contact until their skin temperature reached 283 K (50 ºF) or until they felt sufficient discomfort to end the test themselves. While HITL testing is critical for final certification of gloves, iterative design and development testing would benefit from a faster, less expensive test. To meet this need, the NESC is developing a glove thermal test that uses a custom manikin hand designed by Thermetrics, LLC (Figure 8B). Figure 8. A) Mandrel used in cut testing as designed for ambient testing (left) and cryogenic testing (right). Flow channels allow for liquid nitrogen flow to cool the material sample to cryogenic temperatures. B) Prototype of Thermetrics, LLC custom manikin hand for spacesuit glove thermal testing. The manikin hand is outfitted with temperature and heat flux sensors to monitor heat transfer to the hand. The hand is placed within a spacesuit glove and thermally controlled with internal water flow to simulate human heat generation. The Cryogenic Ice Transfer, Acquisition, Development, and Excavation Laboratory (CITADEL) chamber at JPL is then used to test the glove thermal performance at a range of temperatures from 200 K down to 48 K. Thermal performance is evaluated to mimic historical HITL testing under both radiative and conductive cooling. Conductive cooling is accomplished through a temperature-controlled touch object and is evaluated using two touch pressures. All three methods will be incorporated as ASTM F47 standard test procedures following NASA and ASTM committee review and approvals (targeting 2024).

I am grateful for President Biden’s leadership as we continue to make moonshot after moonshot to end cancer as we know it.” Also participating in the event was Dr. W.

As the second leading cause of death in the United States, the President and First Lady’s Cancer Moonshot is a national effort to end cancer. Nelson noted several related experiments space station astronauts have conducted aboard the orbital laboratory for the benefit of all including protein crystal growth, nanoparticle drug delivery, tissue engineering, and stem cell research. In addition to $2.9 billion across HHS in the President’s fiscal year 2025 budget proposal, Becerra discussed his agency’s capabilities to accelerate progress toward the President’s moonshot goals. “Eliminating cancer as we know it is a goal that unifies the country,” said Becerra. “We all know someone, and most of us love someone, who has battled this terrible disease. As we did during the race to the Moon, we believe our technology and scientific community are capable of making the impossible a reality when it comes to ending cancer as we know it.” The backdrop for the event was NASA’s Earth Information Center, which provides access to NASA satellites and other data to see how our planet is changing.

Of all of these, the pair of Deep Space Deployers it has overseen for ESA’s Hera asteroid mission for planetary defence have been by far the most challenging. The two systems need to keep their nanosatellite cargo alive and healthy, before releasing them on a precisely staged basis – at a velocity of just a few centimetres per second. Any faster and Hera’s CubeSats would risk getting lost in space. Deep Space Deployer Once Hera travels to the Dimorphos asteroid it will not go there alone. It will carry with it two CubeSats to gather additional data on its target: the Italian-led Milani CubeSat is equipped with a hyperspectral imager to perform mineral prospecting of the body’s surface while the Luxembourg-led Juventas CubeSat will perform the first subsurface radar probe of an asteroid, going on to touch down and measure surface gravity levels.To keep these nanosatellites in good health through Hera’s two-year cruise phase through deep space and then to check out their independent functioning before releasing precisely as required within the asteroid’s ultra-low gravitational field, the mother spacecraft is equipped with a pair of Deep Space Deployers, built into opposing ends of Hera’s topside. Placement of Deep Space Deployers Slow release in asteroid orbitStandard deployers employed for CubeSat missions to low-Earth orbit serve as a kind of supportive exoskeleton for these tiny items during their turbulent ride to space, then inject them into orbit. Hera’s Deep Space Deployers must operate for much longer. They then have to release their cargo in a gradual and carefully engineered manner.“In complexity terms, our Deep Space Deployer design is equivalent to another onboard instrument,” explains Hera’s ESA system engineer Franco Perez Lissi. “Instead of releasing its CubeSat with a big spring like a standard deployer, pushing away from the parent at around two metres per second, we need to release two orders of magnitude more slowly, because the asteroid gravity is less than a millionth of Earth’s. If we release any quicker then the CubeSat could well miss the asteroid altogether. Deployment test using pendulum “In addition, the two DSD will be used to communicate with their CubeSats, throughout Hera’s approximately two-year voyage to Dimorphos, exchange telemetry and telecommands, update software, charge batteries, test reaction wheels and perform final health checks.”Ralph Slootweg, lead mechanical design engineer at ISISPACE adds: “Then, when we get ready to deploy each CubeSat, this does not happen all at once. We begin with springs that push the CubeSat up to the top of the DSD, but it will remain linked to Hera through an umbilical for power and communications. Over an approximately 24-hour period each CubeSat will have its systems activated and checked out while exposed to space – including the inter-satellite links that will be used to communicate back with Hera – before undergoing their final release, intended to occur not only slowly but also precisely, minimising any imparted rotation which would need precious onboard cold-gas propellant to correct.” Check-out before deployment Vibration test of Deep Space Deployer Ralph notes that this is very much a change from the standard quick-release approach : “The reason for deploying this way is that in Earth orbit there are ground stations available to communicate immediately with newly-deployed CubeSats. Out at Dimorphos there will only be Hera.”The DSD’s CubeSat Release System that will give each CubeSat their final push away had to tested in terrestrial gravity, which meant employing a pendulum-based rig plus high-speed cameras to validate that the desired velocity would be reached at Dimorphos.The overall DSD design also had to be subjected to a full qualification campaign, including environmental testing to check if it can survive the launch and cruise phases. Deep Space Deployer''s Life Support Interface Board ESA Mechanisms engineer Ewelina Ryszawa comments: “This was certainly a challenge – we experienced a failure during the vibration test, so we had to redesign some subsystems: add in extra margin, with a stronger actuation spring and reducing friction elsewhere. It ended up a good problem-solving exercise.”Interface with HeraThe DSD also serves as the de-facto interface between Hera and its CubeSats – a crucial role because these two types of spacecraft have been built to very different standards. Juventas CubeSat coming in for asteroid landing “At the base of each DSD is its Life Support Interface Board, LSIB, which is the connection between Hera and each of the two CubeSats,” explains Tatsuo Shimizu, LSIB project manager and designer at Finland’s Kuva Space. “The LSIB converts signals and power voltage between the two sides, and also performs isolation in the event of any CubeSat failure. Essentially, all of Hera’s interaction with the CubeSats in their DSDs takes place via the LSIBs.”Tatsuo worked hard through the COVID-19 pandemic to meet the LSIB’s strict deadline, having to spend thousands of euros to phone around component suppliers in response to supply chain disruptions, adapting the LSIB design accordingly.Maria Hieta, overseeing product assurance for the LSIB at the Finnish Meteorological Institute, FMI, adds: “While Hera is built using traditional space-grade components, following all applicable European Cooperation on Space Standardization, ECSS, standards, miniaturised CubeSats can use lower grade parts and take more risks in the design. The Incredible Adventures of the Hera mission – Presenting Hera Access the video “Overall this is a strength, but the Hera team needs to be sure that any CubeSat problem would not spread to the main spacecraft as well, such as an overvoltage. For this reason, the LSIB is built with space qualified parts following the same standards as Hera. Our institute has plenty of experience in developing hardware to ECSS standards, so we undertook the product assurance for the LSIB, while Beyond Gravity in Finland performed the soldering.”The DSDs have now been accepted, delivered and integrated aboard Hera. Once the CubeSats complete their testing, they will be installed aboard the DSDs for integrated testing.Find out more about the fascinating asteroids populating our Solar System, the space missions seeking to explore them and the ways Earth is being safeguarded from impact threats in the webcast for the UN-sanctioned Asteroid Day this Friday, 30 June.

Global average sea level rose by about 0.3 inches (0.76 centimeters) from 2022 to 2023, a relatively large jump due mostly to a warming climate and the development of a strong El Niño. The total rise is equivalent to draining a quarter of Lake Superior into the ocean over the course of a year.

NASA/JPL-Caltech “Current rates of acceleration mean that we are on track to add another 20 centimeters of global mean sea level by 2050, doubling the amount of change in the next three decades compared to the previous 100 years and increasing the frequency and impacts of floods across the world,” said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director for the NASA sea level change team and the ocean physics program in Washington. Seasonal Effects Global sea level saw a significant jump from 2022 to 2023 due mainly to a switch between La Niña and El Niño conditions. A mild La Niña from 2021 to 2022 resulted in a lower-than-expected rise in sea level that year. A strong El Niño developed in 2023, helping to boost the average amount of rise in sea surface height. La Niña is characterized by cooler-than-normal ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Niño involves warmer-than-average ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Both periodic climate phenomena affect patterns of rainfall and snowfall as well as sea levels around the world. “During La Niña, rain that normally falls in the ocean falls on the land instead, temporarily taking water out of the ocean and lowering sea levels,” said Josh Willis, a sea level researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “In El Niño years, a lot of the rain that normally falls on land ends up in the ocean, which raises sea levels temporarily.” To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlaySkip BackwardSkip ForwardMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration -:-Loaded: 0%Stream Type LIVESeek to live, currently behind liveLIVERemaining Time --:- 1xPlayback RateChaptersChaptersDescriptionsdescriptions off, selectedCaptionscaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions offEnglish, selectedAudio TrackPicture-in-PictureFullscreenThis is a modal window.The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.Beginning of dialog window.

This animation shows the rise in global mean sea level from 1993 to 2023 based on data from a series of five international satellites. The spike in sea level from 2022 to 2023 is mostly a consequence of climate change and the development of El Niño conditions in the Pacific Ocean. Credit: NASA’s Scientific Visualization Studio A Human Footprint Seasonal or periodic climate phenomena can affect global average sea level from year to year. But the underlying trend for more than three decades has been increasing ocean heights as a direct response to global warming due to the excessive heat trapped by greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere. “Long-term datasets like this 30-year satellite record allow us to differentiate between short-term effects on sea level, like El Niño, and trends that let us know where sea level is heading,” said Ben Hamlington, lead for NASA’s sea level change team at JPL. These multidecadal observations wouldn’t be possible without ongoing international cooperation, as well as scientific and technical innovations by NASA and other space agencies. Specifically, radar altimeters have helped produce ever-more precise measurements of sea level around the world. To calculate ocean height, these instruments bounce microwave signals off the sea surface, recording the time the signal takes to travel from a satellite to Earth and back, as well as the strength of the return signal. The researchers also periodically cross-check those sea level measurements against data from other sources. These include tide gauges, as well as satellite measurements of factors like atmospheric water vapor and Earth’s gravity field that can affect the accuracy of sea level measurements. Using that information, the researchers recalibrated the 30-year dataset, resulting in updates to sea levels in some previous years. That includes a sea level rise increase of 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) from 2021 to 2022. When researchers combine space-based altimetry data of the oceans with more than a century of observations from surface-based sources, such as tide gauges, the information dramatically improves our understanding of how sea surface height is changing on a global scale. When these sea level measurements are combined with other information, including ocean temperature, ice loss, and land motion, scientists can decipher why and how seas are rising.

Wolk This image shows a quasar, a rapidly growing supermassive black hole, which is not achieving what astronomers would expect from it, as reported in our latest press release. Data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory (blue) and radio data from the NSF’s Karl G. Jansky’s Very Large Array (red) reveal some of the evidence for this quasar’s disappointing impact on its host galaxy. Known as H1821+643, this quasar is about 3.4 billion light-years from Earth. Quasars are a rare and extreme class of supermassive black holes that are furiously pulling material inwards, producing intense radiation and sometimes powerful jets. H1821+643 is the closest quasar to Earth in a cluster of galaxies. Quasars are different than other supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxy clusters in that they are pulling in more material at a higher rate. Astronomers have found that non-quasar black holes growing at moderate rates influence their surroundings by preventing the intergalactic hot gas from cooling down too much. This regulates the growth of stars around the black hole. The influence of quasars, however, is not as well known. This new study of H1821+643 that quasars — despite being so active — may be less important in driving the fate of their host galaxy and cluster than some scientists might expect. To reach this conclusion the team used Chandra to study the hot gas that H1821+643 and its host galaxy are shrouded in. The bright X-rays from the quasar, however, made it difficult to study the weaker X-rays from the hot gas. The researchers carefully removed the X-ray glare to reveal what the black hole’s influence is, which is reflected in the new composite image showing X-rays from hot gas in the cluster surrounding the quasar. This allowed them to see that the quasar is actually having little effect on its surroundings. Using Chandra, the team found that the density of gas near the black hole in the center of the galaxy is much higher, and the gas temperatures much lower, than in regions farther away. Scientists expect the hot gas to behave like this when there is little or no energy input (which would typically come from outbursts from a black hole) to prevent the hot gas from cooling down and flowing towards the center of the cluster.

Its advanced sensors have successfully detected the impact of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) including those that occurred during February 10-11, 2024. PAPA is an energy and mass analyzer designed for in-situ measurements of solar wind electrons and ions in the low energy range. It has two sensors: the Solar Wind Electron Energy Probe (SWEEP, measuring electrons in the energy range of 10 eV to 3 keV) and the Solar Wind Ion Composition Analyser (SWICAR, measuring ions in the energy range of 10 eV to 25 keV and mass range of 1-60 amu). The sensors are also equipped to measure the direction of arrival of solar wind particles. The payload has been operational since December 12, 2023. Its observations during the Halo Orbit Insertion (HOI) phase are shown in Figure 1. The figure illustrates the time series of SWEEP electron energy spectra and total count observed during the HOI phase and the period preceding and succeeding it. It reveals about three-order magnitude change in electron counts from 10 eV to 3000 eV. The majority of electrons have energy below 40 eV. It displays an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and energy resolution. Drastic reduction in the electron energy spectra and the total count occurs during the HOI phase due to the change in payload orientation away from the sun direction during this orbit maneuvering period. This is also evident in the ion energy spectra observed using SWICAR (Figure 2). Figure 1: Time series of SWEEP electron energy spectra taken from 04:00:30 UTC to 17:59:58 UTC on January 6, 2024, covering Pre-HOI, HOI and Post-HOI phases.

Figure 2 shows the time series of SWICAR ion energy spectra and integrated counts during the specified timeframe. It exhibits the expected patterns of ion energy spectra under normal space weather conditions. The ion energy spectrum indicates the dominance of protons (H+ @ 1 amu at around 800 eV) and alpha particles (He++ @ 2 amu at around 1600 eV). The ability of SWICAR to identify individual ion masses aligns with its design. The electron (SWEEP) and ion (SWICAR) energy spectra observed before and after the HOI phase are comparable.

The data collected by PAPA revealed the occurrence of Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) events, notably on December 15, 2023, and during February 10-11, 2024, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The CME on December 15, 2023, was a single event. PAPA observations during this period (Figure 3) showed an abrupt increase in total electron and ion counts and the time variations align with the solar wind parameters and magnetic field measurements obtained from the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellites at the L1 point. In contrast, the observed variations in electron and ion counts during February 10-11, 2024 are the result of multiple minor events, with differences in the time variations of electrons and ions.

GRASS gravimeter The GRASS gravimeter will be landed on the surface of the Dimorphos asteroid aboard the Juventas CubeSat – which will itself be deployed from ESA’s Hera mission for planetary defence – and is designed to measure an expected gravity level of less than a millionth of Earth’s own.The Gravimeter for Small Solar System Objects, GRASS, has been developed by the Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB) with Spain’s EMXYS company. Juventas radar CubeSat To prove it was ready for integration with Hera’s Juventas CubeSat, GRASS was subjected to spacelike vacuum and temperature extremes within a thermal vacuum chamber, then underwent sustained shaking to mimic the violence of a rocket launch.“It may be small but GRASS is packed with complex mechanical parts and electronics,” explains Jose Carrasco, overseeing the instruments at EMXYS. “We’re very happy with its endurance during the test campaign. We will now follow up with a full integrity test to ensure it has sustained no damage during the testing, after which it will be passed to the GomSpace company in Luxembourg for integration aboard Juventas.” LICIACube image of asteroid ejecta The L-shaped instrument, the size of two smartphones stuck together, is designed to measure miniscule gravity levels because the Dimorphos asteroid it will touch down on is the smallest planetary object ever to be visited by a spacecraft. At around 160 m in diameter it is about the same size as Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza.Dimorphos became famous last year when it was impacted by NASA’s DART spacecraft, sending out plumes of debris thousands of kilometres across space and measurably shifting its orbit around the larger Didymos asteroid. Hera, her CubeSats, and their rocky target destination “ESA’s Hera mission is Europe’s contribution to an international experiment in planetary defence,” explains Hera system engineer Hannah Goldberg. “Following the DART impact, Hera will gather close-up data on the Dimorphos asteroid to turn this kinetic impact experiment into a well-understood and in principle repeatable method of planetary defence. GRASS’s surface gravity measurements will help researchers learn the precise mass of the asteroid, along with radio science experiments performed by the main Hera spacecraft.”The GRASS gravimeter design involves two sets of thin blades which are anchored within cradles, both of which are continuously rotating. The slightest motion of each blade changes the overall voltage of the blade itself and its surrounding walls. This capacitance-based measuring technique gives the gravimeter a sensitivity equivalent of a single micrometre – or thousandth of a millimetre. GRASS gravimeter on shaker Özgür Karatekin of ROB adds: “Obviously the real-world performance of the gravimeter cannot be demonstrated directly here on Earth, but our lab testing coupled with numerical simulations showed we have achieved sufficiently high sensitivity to detect such low gravity.”The GRASS team also had to design an instrument small enough to fit into the Juventas CubeSat, itself only the size of a shoebox, along with Juventas’ main radar instrument. In the event their final design is just 330 grams in mass and requires only half a watt of power. GRASS gravimeter readied for vacuum chamber Jose Carrasco notes: “The Royal Observatory of Belgium contributed the mechanical design, including the two blades, cradles and rotating motors, while EMXYS had to put together sufficiently compact electronics to operate the instrument, including copious use of commercial off the shelf parts.”GRASS will be turned on as Juventas gradually falls to the surface of Dimorphos following the conclusion of its subsurface radar imaging campaign. The gravimeter will record the impact on the asteroid, any subsequent bounces and then any shifts in surface gravity over time, due to the influence of its parent Didymos asteroid. Juventas CubeSat coming in for asteroid landing Özgür Karatekin explains: “We have to assume that Juventas could land at any angle on Dimorphos, so that potentially its solar arrays will be blocked from generating any further power. Instead GRASS will run on Juventas’s internal battery for up to 20 hours.“In addition, because the instrument’s two gravimeters are positioned at right angles from each other, and go on rotating, the instrument can construct the 3D gravity vector and monitor its variations from any landing position.” GRASS in thermal vacuum chamber Once integrated within Juventas, GRASS will subsequently be tested as part of the overall nanosatellite.Based at ESA’s ESTEC technical centre in the Netherlands, the Mechanical Systems Lab is equipped for environmental testing of instruments, subsystems or entire small spacecraft. It is one of a suite of around 35 ESTEC labs, tasked with investigating every aspect of the space environment.

A pulse profile of the Crab pulsar is generated from the observations carried out by POLIX during January 15-18, 2024. The Crab pulsar, a pulsating star, resides near the center of the Crab Nebula and spins about its axis approximately 30 times per second. The plot illustrates the time window of X-rays scattered by the Beryllium scatterer inside POLIX, originally emitted from the Crab pulsar. This plot represents the first of its kind in this energy range. The data in lower and greater than this energy range are available from different missions. The X-axis indicates the time for two pulses, about 67 ms in total. The plot also has the timing of non-pulsed emission components from the Pulsar Wind Nebula surrounding the pulsar. The time window facilitates determining the X-rays emitted from the pulsar (but not from the wind nebula). The polarization of X-rays from the source is detectable as the degree of asymmetry in the scattering of X-rays in the instrument depends on the polarization of the incoming X-rays. The POLIX payload was activated in two stages by January 10, 2024, and initial scan observations were conducted around the Crab pulsar, the intended first target. The data plotted was collected during January 15-18, 2024, and thoroughly reviewed for confirmation. The data aligns with expectations. This initial observation is a significant milestone for POLIX, showcasing its functionality and readiness for investigating pulsars, black holes, and other astronomical sources. As the sole payload offering data in this energy band, POLIX is poised to offer unique insights and contribute to understanding the physical processes associated with Astronomical X-ray sources.

The two streams, named Shakti and Shiva, helped form the infant Milky Way. Both are so ancient they likely formed before even the oldest parts of our present-day galaxy’s spiral arms and disc.“What’s truly amazing is that we can detect these ancient structures at all,” says Khyati Malhan of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany, who led the research. “The Milky Way has changed so significantly since these stars were born that we wouldn’t expect to recognise them so clearly as a group – but the unprecedented data we’re getting from Gaia made it possible.” Gaia unravels two ancient streams of stars in the Milky Way Using Gaia observations, the researchers were able to determine the orbits of individual stars in the Milky Way, along with their content and composition. “When we visualised the orbits of all these stars, two new structures stood out from the rest among stars of a certain chemical composition,” adds Khyati. “We named them Shakti and Shiva.” Truly ancient fragments Each stream contains the mass of about 10 million Suns, with stars of 12 to 13 billion years in age all moving in very similar orbits with similar compositions. The way they’re distributed suggests that they may have formed as distinct fragments that merged with the Milky Way early in its life.Both streams lie towards the Milky Way’s heart. Gaia explored this part of the Milky Way in 2022 using a kind of ‘galactic archaeology’; this showed the region to be filled with the oldest stars in the entire galaxy, all born before the disc of the Milky Way had even properly formed. The starry streams making up the Milky Way “The stars there are so ancient that they lack many of the heavier metal elements created later in the Universe’s lifetime. These heavy metals are those forged within stars and scattered through space when they die. The stars in our galaxy’s heart are metal-poor, so we dubbed this region the Milky Way’s ‘poor old heart’,” says co-author Hans-Walter Rix, also of MPIA and the lead ‘galactic archaeologist’ from the 2022 work.“Until now, we had only recognised these very early fragments that came together to form the Milky Way’s ancient heart. With Shakti and Shiva, we now see the first pieces that seem comparably old but located further out. These signify the first steps of our galaxy''s growth towards its present size.” A complex family tree While very similar, the two streams are not identical. Shakti stars orbit a little further from the Milky Way’s centre and in more circular orbits than Shiva stars. Fittingly, the streams are named after a divine couple from Hindu philosophy who unite to create the Universe (or macrocosm). Anatomy of the Milky Way Some 12 billion years ago, the Milky Way looked very different to the orderly spiral we see today. We think that our galaxy formed as multiple long, irregular filaments of gas and dust coalesced, all forming stars and wrapping together to spark the birth of our galaxy as we know it. It seems that Shaki and Shiva are two of these components – and future Gaia data releases may reveal more.Khyati and Hans-Walter also built a dynamical map of other known components that have played a role in our galaxy’s formation and were discovered using Gaia data. These include Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, LMS1/Wukong, Arjuna/Sequoia/I’itoi, and Pontus. These star groups all form part of the Milky Way’s complex family tree, something that Gaia has worked to build over the past decade.“Revealing more about our galaxy’s infancy is one of Gaia’s goals, and it’s certainly achieving it,” says Timo Prusti, Project Scientist for Gaia at ESA. “We need to pinpoint the subtle yet crucial differences between stars in the Milky Way to understand how our galaxy formed and evolved. This requires incredibly precise data – and now, thanks to Gaia, we have that data. As we discover surprise parts of our galaxy like the Shiva and Shakti streams, we’re filling the gaps and painting a fuller picture of not only our current home, but our earliest cosmic history.” Simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy forming Access the video Notes for editors ''Shiva and Shakti: Presumed Proto-Galactic Fragments in the Inner Milky Way'' by K.

The spacecraft will carry Milani and a second CubeSat, the Juventas radar imaging spacecraft for probing into the target asteroid, which together will be ESA’s first CubeSats to operate in deep space. Tyvak''s Milani CubeSat team Funded through the Italian Space Agency, ASI, the Milani CubeSat was shown to the press at the premises of its prime contractor Tyvak International in Turin. It will now be flown to ESA’s ESTEC Test Centre in the Netherlands, where Hera is currently undergoing pre-flight testing, for integration with its mothership and subsequent validation of the inter-satellite link system that will connect Hera, Milani and Juventas as they fly around the Didymos system.“This is a paramount achievement for Tyvak International,” explains Margherita Cardi, VP Programmes for Tyvak International and Milani Programme Manager. “Milani is now ready to be delivered to ESA and undergo the system tests with Hera, to ensure the validation of the interfaces and the end-to-end communication prior to the launch. The journey is not over, but we are a step closer to Didymos, and it was a real honour to host here at Tyvak all the persons who contributed to this amazing project and celebrate together this achievement.” Alice Milani, daughter of the man the CubeSat is named for Origin of Hera missionAlso present at Milani’s delivery event was Alice Milani, daughter of the man the CubeSat was named for. Andrea Milani, professor of mathematics at the University of Pisa, was a planetary defence pioneer who first devised what became ESA’s Near Earth Object Coordination Centre, based at the Agency’s ESRIN centre in Frascati, Italy. Then in 2004 he proposed the idea of a double spacecraft planetary defence mission called Don Quijote. One spacecraft – called Hidalgo – would impact a non-threatening asteroid while another spacecraft – called Sancho – would gather data to validate asteroid impact models.His proposal evolved into the NASA’s DART mission (formerly Hidalgo) – which in 2022 diverted the orbit of Dimorphos around Didymos – and the follow-up Hera mission (formerly Sancho) to gather close-up data on the mass and makeup of the asteroid and DART’s impact site. Sadly, Andrea never lived to see the implementation of his idea, passing away unexpectedly in 2018. Milani scans Didymos Milani to stay linked with its mothershipMilani will survey Dimorphos as well as the larger Didymos object that the asteroid orbits around in a wider range of colours than the human eye can see, to identify the mineral makeup of the asteroids and even individual boulders resting on them. It will also survey the dust environment surrounding these bodies. And the inter-satellite link system between the Hera mothership and its smaller companions will track small tugs in their relative positions due to the gravitational pulls of the asteroids, helping to assess their mass. Hera’s CubeSat deployment process Access the video But the miniature Milani is also a full-fledged spacecraft in its own right, incorporating a visible light camera, laser altimeter and star trackers for navigation, plus a cold gas propulsion system. While Hera will orbit about 20 – 10 km from the asteroids, Milani will risk lower altitudes, starting at 10 km and coming as close as 2 km. Going into a traditional orbit around the Didymos system is impractical because of its extremely low gravity. Instead Milani will fly a series of ‘hyberbolic arcs’ in its vicinity, like repeated flybys involving its thrusters regularly changing direction to remain as close as required.Finally, Milani will attempt a landing on Dimorphos. Its onboard gyros and accelerometers will gather valuable data on the landing and any subsequent low-gravity bounces, to give insight into the surface properties of the asteroid. Milani''s new mission patch, chosen through a contest First ESA CubeSats in deep spaceCubeSats are small, low-cost satellites built up from 10 cm boxes, traditionally employed for educational purposes but increasingly finding operational uses in Earth orbit. Milani and Juventas will be the first ESA CubeSats to remain several months in deep space, operating in close proximity to a small Solar System body.They will spend Hera’s two-year cruise phase to Didymos inside a pair of ‘Deep Space Deployers’ which will keep them alive and healthy. The pair will be deployed one at a time, starting with a partial deployment to check each CubeSat’s functionality. Finally, they will be deployed at just a few centimetres per second – any faster and they would risk being lost in space within the prevailing low gravity. Working on Milani CubeSat Milani instrumentsMilani is a ‘6-unitXL’ CubeSat measuring just 13 x 24.6 x 36.6 cm in size. On one side of Milani are the four sensors of its main ASPECT, Asteroid Spectral Imager, instrument developed by the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, which will image the asteroids in visible, near and shortwave infrared bands.“ASPECT is a hyperspectral imager whose heritage goes back to a series of instruments flown on drones, variously used for agricultural, forestry and pollution monitoring,” explains Antti Näsilä, Principal Scientist and ASPECT project manager at VTT. Milani CubeSat in Tyvak cleanroom “So the miniaturisation involved meant that switching to CubeSats was a straightforward transition, and a predecessor version of the instrument flew on Finland’s first CubeSat, Aalto-1 in 2017. But despite ASPECT’s small size it is extremely complex, with each of the four channels requiring roughly 50 control signals each, criss-crossing through the instrument.”MILANI’s second instrument is VISTA, Volatile In-Situ Thermogravimetre Analyser, an Italian-built dust detector. This is based on quartz microcrystals whose piezoelectric responses are altered slightly by the adhesion of tiny dust particles. Milani studies asteroid dust Ernesto Palomba of Italy’s Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali, VISTA’s principal investigator, explains: "On Earth this same precision technology is used in analytical laboratories and checking thin film deposition processes. VISTA will use it to identify water and other volatile species around the asteroids, as well as the presence of dust. We hope our instrument will be able to keep operating even on the surface of Dimorphos.”Hera’s ESA system engineer Franco Perez Lissi Comments: ”ESA’s first deep-space CubeSat was developed in record time by an incredible team. ESA is extremely impressed by the skills, motivation and commitment of Tyvak International.

FutureNAV enables ESA to respond to trends and needs in the field of positioning, navigation and timing, and allows Europe to stay on the cutting edge of satellite navigation technology. Genesis, a flying observatory to measure Earth down to the millimetre Genesis satellite Genesis will contribute to a highly improved International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) of Earth with an accuracy of 1 mm and a long-term stability of 0.1 mm/year, providing a coordinate system for the most rigorous navigation applications on our planet.The ITRF serves as a reference for all space- and ground-based observations for navigation and Earth sciences. An updated International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) will have immediate benefits on satellite-based systems, impacting Galileo-enabled applications in fields like aviation, traffic management, autonomous vehicles, positioning and navigation. In addition, an enhanced ITRF will benefit countless other fields: meteorology, natural hazard prediction, monitoring climate change effects, land management and surveying, study of gravitational and non-gravitational forces, to name a few.Genesis’ extreme accuracy will be achieved by co-locating the main geodetic (Earth-measuring) techniques: satellite navigation ranging, very-long-baseline interferometry, satellite laser ranging and possibly DORIS onboard one well-calibrated satellite that acts as a flying observatory, which will allow to determine biases inherent to each technique and correct them for superior precision. The instruments will be synchronized by an ultra-stable oscillator (USO). Discover Genesis - Instruments LEO-PNT, a resilient navigation system of systems LEO-PNT satellite LEO-PNT (low Earth orbit positioning navigation and timing) is a small constellation of demonstration satellites that will fly close to Earth and test the use of novel signals and frequency bands, unlocking exceptional resilience, accuracy and speed in navigation that will potentially enable a long list of new applications and services.The constellation will demonstrate the benefits of working in combination with Galileo and other global navigation satellite systems in a multi-layer approach. LEO-PNT will assure signals to improve robustness of existing GNSS in medium Earth orbit such as natural phenomena impairments and interferences, and provide services to places where today’s satnav systems cannot reach deep urban areas and even indoors. This mission will also demonstrate the capability of a LEO navigation constellation to provide a monitoring capability for Galileo and EGNOS signals from space. Another objective of this mission is to demonstrate the interoperability of PNT with open communication standards, including 5G/6G, opening the door to new applications for Internet-of-Things, emergency services and low latency data for positioning and timing.The applications that a navigation constellation in low Earth orbit can enable together with existing GNSS range from transportation including automotive, autonomous vehicles, rail and maritime and digital mobility in general, critical infrastructure, mobile devices, asset tracking or indoor.

While some parts may reach the ground, the casualty risk – the likelihood of a person being hit – is very low.The reentry will occur between -51.6 degrees South and 51.6 degrees North. Large uncertainties, primarily driven by fluctuating levels of atmospheric drag, prevent more precise predictions at this time. The closer we get to the expected reentry window, the better the concerned region can be geographically constrained. ESA is monitoring the object and, upon request, providing ESA Member States with the latest predictions for the time and location of the reentry, which they then combine with their own analyses.A large space object reenters the atmosphere in a natural way approximately once per week, with the majority of the associated fragments burning up before reaching the ground. Most spacecraft, launch vehicles and operational hardware are designed to limit the risks associated with a reentry.

One of the first features Hera will look for is the crater left on Dimorphos by its predecessor mission DART, which impacted the asteroid to deflect its orbit. Yet a new impact simulation study reported in Nature Astronomy today suggests no crater will be found. The DART impact is likely to have remodelled the entire body instead – a significant finding for both asteroid science and planetary defence. Dimorphos asteroid seen by DART On 26 September 2022 NASA’s approximately half-tonne DART spacecraft impacted the boulder covered Dimorphos asteroid at a speed of 6.1 km/s.This first experiment in the kinetic impact method of asteroid deflection was successful: observations from Earth show the 11 hour 55 minute orbit of Dimorphos around its parent asteroid Didymos was shortened by around 33 minutes (measured to an uncertainty level of plus or minus a minute). DART approaching Dimorphos What researchers still don’t know is how the asteroid as a whole reacted to the spacecraft impact, or the overall efficiency of momentum transfer. Calculating this latter ‘beta factor’ value requires precise knowledge of the asteroid’s mass which will be eventually measured by Hera.Also needed to derive the beta factor is an accurate measurement of the recoil from material splashed back into space. For the time being tantalising clues have emerged, including images acquired by the nearby Italian LICIACube for up to five minutes and 20 seconds after DART hit, plus images from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes, as well as terrestrial observatories. These all show a giant plume of debris that extended more than 10 000 km into space and persisted for months. How DART impacted Dimorphos To get a close-up look at the post-impact Dimorphos, scientists will have to wait for the arrival of ESA’s Hera spacecraft. Due for launch this October, Hera will arrive at Dimorphos at the end of 2026, equipped with an array of instruments and supporting miniature ‘CubeSats’ to assess the make-up, structure and mass of Dimorphos, and reveal how the high-speed impact has transformed it (the very name Dimorphos comes from the Greek for ‘having two forms’).In the meantime, an international research team has gained advance insight into DART’s impact by simulating it with the Bern Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) impact code. This software system, developed at the University of Bern over two decades, is designed to replicate the collisional breakup of rocky bodies. Ejecta from DART''s impact Bern SPH works by converting colliding bodies into millions of particles whose behaviour upon impact is determined by the interplay of various reconfigurable variables, such as the asteroid’s gravity, density or material strength. It has been validated by laboratory experiments and has also been used to reproduce one existing asteroid impact test – when Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft slammed a small copper impactor into the Ryugu asteroid in 2019.“The code runs on a High Performance Computing Cluster here at the University,” explains Sabina Raducan of the Space Research and Planetary Science, Physics Institute of the University of Bern, leading the team and co-chair of the Hera Impact Physics Working Group. Stereoscopic view of DART impact simulation “This is a computationally intensive process, with each simulation taking around a week and a half to run, and we ran around 250 simulations overall, reproducing the first two hours after impact. We incorporated all the values we did know – such as the mass of the DART spacecraft, the approximate shape of the asteroid, the orbital deflection and the size of the impact plume – while varying the factors we don’t know, such as the closeness of packing of boulders, their density, the porosity of material and its overall cohesion. We also made some reasonable assumptions based on the physical properties of meteorites resembling Dimorphos.“Then what we did is check which of the simulation run outcomes most closely match observed reality. The results indicate that Dimorphos is a relatively weak ‘rubble pile’ asteroid, held together by the asteroid’s extremely weak gravity rather than cohesive strength. This helps to account for the unexpectedly high efficiency of DART’s orbital deflection.” Comparing observation with simulation of DART impact To understand cohesion in everyday life, think about pouring a stream of flour as opposed to sand. Falling grains of flour will form into a high-angled conical shape because of their greater cohesive strength, while sand will end up making a much flatter heap.“A cratering event is normally concluded by either the force of gravity or the strength of the material being cratered,” adds Martin Jutzi from the University of Bern, also co-chairing Hera Impact Physics Working Group. “On Earth the force of gravity is such that cratering occurs briefly, producing a typical cratering cone angle of around 90 degrees. What we saw with DART’s impact of Dimorphos was a much wider ejecta cone angle extending by up to 160 degrees, influenced mainly by the curved shape of the asteroid’s surface. And the crater kept on expanding, because both the gravity and material cohesion are so low.” Stereoscopic view simulating approximately 178 seconds after DART impact Sabina adds: “The likelihood is that the crater grew to encompass the entire body itself, so that Dimorphos ended up being completely reshaped. As a consequence Hera will probably not be able to find any crater left by DART. What it will discover instead will be a very different body. Our simulations suggest that Dimorphos has had its initial flying saucer shape blunted on its impact side: if you think of Dimorphos as starting out as resembling a chocolate M&M, now it would look like it has had a bite taken out of it!”This change will also have had consequences for Dimorphos’s orbit around its Didymos parent. To help interpret the results of the simulated reshaping, the team made use of stereoscopic images prepared by Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Sir Brian May with his collaborator Claudia Manzoni.This prolonged cratering event increased the efficiency of the deflection considerably; the team estimates that 1% of the entire mass of Dimorphos was thrown into space by DART’s impact, thanks to its low escape velocity of just 10 cm/s. And around 8% of the asteroid’s mass was shifted around its body. Sir Brian May, astrophysicist and rock star And if Dimorphos is a rubble pile – hanging in orbit more like a bunch of grapes, rather than a solid monolith – then this finding also has important consequences for the body’s likely origin. It strengthens the hypothesis that the moonlet was formed by a past ‘spin-up’ of its parent flinging equatorial material into space that later coalesced together due to gravity.“The big picture we end up, of Dimorphos as an almost cohesionless body shaped largely by the weak force of gravity, does seem to agree with our up-close observations of other asteroids,” notes Patrick Michel Director of Research at CNRS at Observatoire de la Côte d''Azur in Nice and Hera’s Principal Investigator. Hera approaches Dimorphos “Ryugu – visited by Hayabusa2 – and Bennu – visited by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft – are carbon rich ‘C-class’ asteroids, very different from the silicate-rich ‘S-class’ Didymos and Dimorphos, but all of them do seem to possess a comparable lack of cohesion. We still need to understand and clarify this behaviour, because we cannot make statistics on only a trio of asteroids, but a general lack of cohesion for all small asteroids is an intriguing suggestion, and would be good news for planetary defence, because if we know in advance how a body will react, this will make it easier to design the appropriate deflection tools!”Hailing from 24 institutions in all, the team forms part of the larger international Hera Science Working Group. They are looking forward to finding out if their colleagues’ latest observations of the Didymos system validate aspects of their modelling, such as the altered asteroid shape and resulting orbital perturbations, which will eventually be fully made clear by Hera.

The probability of more moderate C- and M-class flares over the next 24 hours is estimated at 99% and 60%, respectively.As AR 3590 is now pointing towards Earth, a CME associated with any future flare is very likely to cause geomagnetic disturbances when it reaches our planet.

No damage to property has been reported. ESA’s second European Remote Sensing satellite, ERS-2, was launched almost 30 years ago, on 21 April 1995. Together with the almost-identical ERS-1, it provided invaluable long-term data on Earth’s land surfaces, ocean temperatures, ozone layer and polar ice extent that revolutionised our understanding of the Earth system. It was also called upon to monitor and assist the response to natural disasters.“The ERS satellites have provided a stream of data which has changed our view of the world in which we live,” said ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli. “They have provided us with new insights on our planet, the chemistry of our atmosphere, the behavior of our oceans, and the effects of mankind’s activity on our environment – creating new opportunities for scientific research and applications.”Having far exceeded its planned lifetime of three years, ESA took the decision to deorbit ERS-2 in 2011 in light of growing concern over the long-term hazard that orbital debris poses to current and future space activities. ERS-2 reentry – how and why is it happening? The satellite’s altitude had been declining steadily ever since. On 21 February 2024, it reached the critical altitude of around 80 km at which the atmospheric drag was so strong that it began to break into pieces.An international campaign involving the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee and ESA’s Space Debris Office monitored the reentry. Atmospheric reentry – past, present and future ERS-2 imaged on 29 January using a camera on board another satellite “Uncontrolled Atmospheric reentry has long been a common method for disposing of space objects at the end of their mission,” said Tim Flohrer, Head of ESA’s Space Debris Office. “We see objects similar in size or larger to ERS-2 reentering the atmosphere multiple times each year.”“In the 67 years of spaceflight, thousands of tons of artificial space objects have reentered the atmosphere. Pieces that make it to the surface have only very rarely caused any damage and there has never been a confirmed report of a human injury.”ERS-2’s reentry was ‘natural’. All of its remaining fuel was depleted during deorbiting to reduce the risk of an internal malfunction causing the satellite to break up into pieces while still at an altitude used by active satellites. As a result, it was not possible to control ERS-2 at any point during its reentry and the only force driving its descent was unpredictable atmospheric drag.This was the best option for disposing of the satellite given the way it was designed in the 1980s. However, the time and location of a natural reentry are difficult to predict prior to the satellite’s final few hours in space. Natural reentries are no longer the gold standard in space sustainability. By implementing the ‘ESA Zero Debris approach’, the Agency is committed to ensuring the long-term sustainability of space activities by mitigating the creation of space debris wherever possible and ensuring the safest possible reentry of satellites at the end of their lives. ESA also aims to encourage others to pursue a similar path through the community-led Zero Debris Charter initiative.ESA’s missions in Earth orbit are now designed to conduct ‘controlled’ reentries. During a controlled reentry, spacecraft operators can ensure that the satellite comes down over sparsely populated regions on Earth such as the South Pacific Ocean.Meanwhile, ESA continues to make efforts to dispose of its older satellites (such as ERS-2, Aeolus, Cluster and Integral) in more sustainable ways than were originally planned. Mission legacy ERS-2, and its predecessor ERS-1, were the most sophisticated satellites ever developed and launched by Europe. The satellite carried a suite of scientific instruments and technologies into orbit that collected valuable data for more than one and a half decades, including Europe''s first instrument to study atmospheric ozone. The ERS heritage datasets are today curated and made accessible through ESA’s Heritage Space Programme.The ERS satellites also set the stage for many successor missions dedicated to studying our changing world, such as Envisat, the MetOp weather satellites, ESA’s Earth Explorer scientific research missions and the Copernicus Sentinels, as well as many other national satellite missions.“ERS heritage data are still widely used today mostly in combination with data from newer missions as long-term data records are for example essential for identifying and understanding changes to our climate,” said ESA’s Heritage Space Programme Manager, Mirko Albani. “The mission is also a great example of how ESA pioneers new technologies that later become operational to support services such as weather forecasting and climate monitoring that benefit the citizens of ESA Member States and people around the world”.

National space agencies operate national reentry warning services and often conduct research to inform future policies and guidelines on safe and sustainable space operations.They share data with ESA and other international partners through forums such as the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee to support the monitoring of satellite reentries.The UK Space Agency recently worked with HEO to capture these images of ERS-2 during its descent. Using cameras on other satellites to image objects reentering the atmosphere is a relatively new approach. In future, these images may be used alongside data from ground-based sensors to refine reentry predictions.These images were captured during ‘flyby’ inspections, during which a satellite photographs an inactive spacecraft, rocket body, upper stage or uncontrolled space debris as it passes. This is opposed to dedicated inspection missions, such as the recently launched Astroscale ADRAS-J mission, which approach an object and conduct prolonged close-proximity investigations. When were they taken? These images were captured on 14 January, 28 January, 29 January and 3 February when ERS-2 was still at an altitude of over 300 km. More details can be found in the image captions. What is ERS-2’s altitude now, and when will it begin to break up? The satellite has since dropped to an altitude of around 200 km. It is now falling by more than 10 km per day and the speed of its descent is increasing rapidly. When it reaches approximately 80 km, it will begin to break into pieces. Most of these pieces will burn up completely. The risks associated with satellite reentries are very low. Why is ERS-2 reentering the atmosphere, and what happens next? ERS-2 reentry – how and why is it happening? The ERS-2 mission came to an end in 2011 when ESA decided to deorbit the satellite and greatly reduce its potential long-term impact on the space environment. The longer that an inactive satellite spends in orbit, the greater the risk of collision with other satellites or pieces of space debris. The deorbiting reduced the time that ERS-2 remained in orbit after the end of its mission from more than 100 years, to less than 15.ERS-2 is now expected to undergo atmospheric reentry and begin to break up on 21 February 2024.

Chelyabinsk a decade on: the Sun''s invisible asteroids When the Chelyabinsk asteroid struck the skies over Russia’s Ural region in February 2013, it highlighted humankind’s fragility.With a mass of around 12 000 tonnes and a size of 19 m, the Chelyabinsk asteroid was the second-largest asteroid to strike Earth in the last century. Impacting the upper atmosphere at a shallow angle and at high speed, it disintegrated, releasing a shockwave that injured more than 1500 people and damaged 7300 buildings. Many people were also injured by shards of flying glass as they peered out of windows to see what was happening.By a strange twist of fate, the Chelyabinsk asteroid struck on the same day that the United Nations Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space Working Group on Near-Earth Objects met in Vienna to finalise a recommendation to the UN on how to defend Earth from possible asteroid impacts. At this meeting, Earth’s experts laid the foundations for the formation of two international bodies that would enable a truly global response to the risk of an asteroid strike: the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG; pronounced ‘same page’). Keeping humankind on the ‘same page’ Mitigation: Asteroid on collision course SMPAG and IAWN are now celebrating their tenth anniversaries, with the first SMPAG meeting taking place on 6-7 February 2014 and the first IAWN meeting taking place in January of the same year.IAWN is coordinated by NASA: it is a worldwide collaboration of asteroid observers, analysts and modellers. When an asteroid is detected on a collision course with Earth, IAWN assesses the impact time, location, and severity.It is IAWN’s job to inform SMPAG and national governments via the UN and to provide the information about the asteroid needed to plan a reactive space mission and for civil disaster preparation and response agencies.SMPAG is chaired by ESA: it serves as a forum for the world’s space agencies and coordinates Earth’s space-based response to the danger. It assesses the possibility of using spacecraft missions (typically not involving oil drillers) to study, deflect or destroy an incoming asteroid larger than 50 m in size and with an impact probability larger than 1 %. It then advises decisionmakers on possible actions to take. No slowing down for ESA’s planetary defenders Apophis orbit diverted by Earth''s gravity During the recent 22nd meeting of SMPAG on 31 January 2024, one of the major topics of discussion was the possible exchange of information between space agencies planning to explore asteroid Apophis.Apophis is a large asteroid, estimated to be around 350 m across, that will safely fly by Earth on 13 April 2029. It will come closer to our planet than the ring of telecommunications and weather forecasting satellites in geostationary orbit.This flyby offers a unique chance to study such a large asteroid up close with a satellite mission, and space agencies intend to make the most of it. ESA is currently studying two mission concepts that would fly to Apophis as it approaches Earth in 2029. Hera approaching Didymos asteroids ESA is also currently preparing to launch its Hera mission. In September 2022, NASA’s DART mission demonstrated a key component of asteroid deflection – an impact in which a spacecraft deliberately crashes into an asteroid to alter its course.Hera will launch in October 2024 and travel to the same asteroid system and measure the results. In doing so, it will help turn this novel experiment into a repeatable planetary defence approach. Future Flyeye telescope However, in order to deflect an asteroid, you first have to spot it. The Minor Planet Center currently catalogues over 34 000 known near-Earth asteroids, and ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre keeps a close eye on them.ESA’s two Test-Bed Telescopes and its upcoming Flyeye telescope are part of a future automated network that will continuously scan the entire sky every night on the hunt for new, potentially dangerous space rocks. Anything this network finds will be checked by a human, before being submitted to the Minor Planet Center to trigger follow-up observations. NEOMIR - in-orbit asteroid spotter But even this network won’t be able to spot the asteroids heading towards Earth while hiding within the glare of the Sun. ESA’s proposed NEOMIR space-based telescope will be located outside of Earth’s distorting atmosphere, and therefore able to rely on infrared light, rather than visible light. By making observations in the infrared, NEOMIR will detect the heat emitted by asteroids themselves, which isn’t drowned out by sunlight.

Just hours later, it struck our planet’s atmosphere 50 km west of Berlin, producing a stunning fireball. Named ''2024 BX1'', this is just the eighth asteroid that humankind has spotted before impact – and the third discovered by Sárneczky. In-depth It was at 22:48 CET on Saturday 20 January when veteran asteroid hunter Sárneczky discovered a new asteroid using the 60 cm Schmidt Telescope at Piszkéstető Mountain Station, part of Konkoly Observatory in Hungary.He immediately sent his data on the asteroid’s trajectory to the Minor Planet Center, but with just three initial observations, it was impossible to know for sure whether it was on a collision course with Earth. Meerkat alert for the impact of object Sar2736 (later designated asteroid 2024 BX1) However, Sárneczky continued tracking the asteroid, and just a few minutes later, he shared four more observations that clearly indicated a 100 % chance of an imminent impact.Automatic impact monitoring systems around the world, including ESA’s ‘Meerkat’, responded to these new data and sprang into action, issuing an alert to astronomers and asteroid experts. Sárneczky continued to make and report his observations and was soon joined by others in Europe. More than a dozen observatories turned their eyes towards the incoming object. With their help, it soon became clear that the small asteroid, roughly one metre in size, would impact Earth in less than two hours, approximately 50 km west of Berlin, Germany.Asteroids of this size strike Earth on average every couple of weeks. They pose no significant danger, and most are never detected. But they can help us understand how many small asteroids are out there and we can study the fireballs they produce to determine what they are made of – if we catch them on camera. ESA''s Gaia spacecraft maps 150 000+ asteroid orbits Thankfully, large asteroids that are many kilometres in diameter are much easier to spot and relatively rare. The vast majority of near-Earth asteroids that would cause devastating damage if they were to impact our planet have already been spotted, and we know of none that will collide with our planet for at least the next one hundred years.As Saturday night became Sunday morning, astronomers continued to track asteroid 2024 BX1 until, at 01:25 CET, it entered Earth’s shadow and disappeared from view. Observers held their breath, but they didn’t have to wait for long. Just a few minutes later, at 01:32 CET, 2024 BX1 struck Earth’s atmosphere and burned an explosive streak through the night sky. Many people in the Berlin area and across central Europe were able to witness the fireball, and a handful of people and automated camera systems even managed to record it. Fireball over Germany created by asteroid 2024 BX1 Access the video Visualisation of the trajectory and impact of asteroid 2024 BX1 on 21 January 2024 Only eight asteroids have ever been detected before impact with Earth’s atmosphere. The first of these discoveries took place in 2008, and four were detected in just the last two years. As humankind’s ability to detect smaller space objects continues to improve, this number is likely to rise exponentially in the coming years.During the three hours between detection and impact, around 180 observations were submitted to the Minor Planet Center, including those of ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre taken from Tenerife, Spain. Asteroid 2024 BX1 tracked prior to impact Thanks to the rapid response and information sharing from Earth’s asteroid and fireball communities, many people were able to see and record this spectacular sight, despite it taking place with just hours’ notice and in the middle of the night.The hunt is now on for any potential meteorites that survived the fiery journey through the atmosphere and made it to the ground.

In-depth Launch rates are dramatically increasing Earth is surrounded by spacecraft carrying out vital work to study our changing climate, deliver global communication and navigation services and help us answer important scientific questions.But important orbits are increasingly churning with destructive, fast-moving pieces of defunct satellites and rockets. Launch rates today are 10 times higher than they were 10 years ago, but compliance with space debris mitigation guidelines has not kept up.ESA studies – such as the ESA Annual Space Environment Report – show how the continuation of our current behaviour could result in some orbital regions becoming unusable due to the high density of space debris, threatening our shared future in space. The growing problem of space debris Current mitigation approaches are not enough to guarantee a sustainable space environment. For this reason, ESA recently introduced its Zero Debris approach, as outlined in Agenda 2025, which aims to significantly limit the production of debris in Earth and lunar orbits by 2030 for all of the Agency’s future missions, programmes and activities.As a first significant step to implement these ambitious goals, ESA updated the Space Debris Mitigation Policy and Requirements applicable to ESA missions.But space is a globally shared resource, and ESA’s actions alone will not be enough. In order to encourage others to pursue a similar path, ESA has also facilitated the preparation of the Zero Debris Charter. The Charter was drawn up by over 40 diverse actors from the space sector and is a global initiative that all space entities may sign and register their commitment to the shared goal of a Zero Debris future. The new Policy Distribution of space debris around Earth ESA’s updated Policy and Requirements will reduce the amount of space debris generated by ESA activities. They came into effect in November 2023 and also serve as the Agency’s first significant steps towards making the goal of the Zero Debris Charter a reality. The new ESA Space Debris Mitigation Policy defines the roles and responsibilities within ESA for space debris mitigation.The Policy clarifies how ESA’s Space Debris Mitigation Requirements (see below) apply to all missions procured and operated by ESA.It also introduces a Space Debris Mitigation Assessment Board, which will advise ESA’s Director General, Josef Aschbacher, in the case of activities that may not meet the Requirements, such as the extension of existing missions. The new Requirements The new ESA Space Debris Mitigation Requirements build upon an existing European framework that has been in effect since 2014, and introduce a series of additional requirements.These include: the duration of the disposal phase in low-Earth orbit has been reduced from 25 to a maximum of five years, with an additional consideration for the mission’s total collision risk with space debris during this disposal phase, and more stringent requirements for satellite constellations; the probability of successful disposal must be larger than 90%, with more stringent requirements for large constellations; space objects operating in protected orbital regions, which are not considered to be “low risk”, must be equipped with interfaces to facilitate servicing by an active debris removal mission in case they fail in orbit; the Requirements introduce a new set of requirements related to collision avoidance and space traffic coordination based on current best practices, such as response time in case of a collision warning; the two emerging issues of avoiding the generation of space debris in lunar orbits and interference to radio and optical astronomy are also addressed with preliminary requirements that will continue to be developed in the coming years. Read more about space debris mitigation here.By adopting these new requirements, on top of existing ones such as the Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, ESA is taking on a leading role in space sustainability and encouraging others to join us on the road to a Zero Debris future.

This competition is an exciting opportunity for students of graphic art or design, or early career graphic artists and designers to make one of their designs a part of space history.You can enter the contest using this online form. Post your design online on social media and include a link.Hera is a planetary defence mission, part of ESA''s Space Safety programme. It is Europe''s contribution to an ambitious double-spacecraft endeavour, testing an asteroid deflection technique for the first time in history. Didymos asteroid system, post-impact First came NASA’s DART spacecraft which impacted asteroid Dimorphos on 26 September 2022, slightly modifying its orbit around its parent asteroid, Didymos.Hera, carrying two smaller CubeSats, will conduct a detailed post-impact survey of Dimorphos gathering unique scientific data in order to turn this grand-scale experiment into a well-understood and repeatable asteroid deflection technique. Hera''s Milani CubeSat, developed and engineered for ESA by Tyvak International in Turin, Italy, is named after Andrea Milani, the late professor of mathematics at Pisa University and pioneer of asteroid impact monitoring. Original Don Quijote mission concept Milani devised the original Don Quijote asteroid deflection demonstration concept: to shift the orbital trajectory of an asteroid through the impact of one spacecraft, while a second spacecraft performs close-up post-impact observations to validate the experiment.The 2005 Don Quijote mission architecture was a paper study but had a wide influence in the planetary defence community, leading almost two decades later to the international Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission. NASA would contribute the DART impactor spacecraft and ESA producing the monitor spacecraft – Hera. Milani CubeSat Milani, one of Hera''s two CubeSats, will be integrated into its mothercraft before the launch and will stay there for a two-year journey to the asteroid. Upon release, Milani will start its mission aiming at enhancing the overall scientific return of the Hera mission. Furthermore, it will have to navigate around the asteroid (using a dedicated Navigation Camera) and communicate with Earth relying on an inter-satellite link with Hera.Milani hosts three scientific instruments: ASPECT is a hyperspectral imager which will take high resolution images of the Didymos and Dimorphos asteroids, mapping the surfaces while focusing on the impact crater created by the DART spacecraft. VISTA, a thermogravimeter, will characterise the Didymos environment by analyzing the presence of fine dust. In addition, Milani''s presence near Didymos will provide observables to the Hera radio-science experiment, to support the characterisation of Didymos'' gravity field. Hera mission patch The Milani Mission patch must be stylistically congruent with the existing Hera mission patch (found here) and represent the core tenets of Milani''s scientific mission. The design shall be implemented within the attached blank Milani patch template (downloadable here in EPS format - the name of the mission to be placed within the patch).The winner will be invited to view the Hera spacecraft in ESTEC''s Test Centre in the Netherlands, a unique experience to view the spacecraft up close and meet with the engineering team which designed it.Read more about the Hera mission here, more about the CubeSats joining Hera, with specific details of the Milani mission here.You can enter the competition using this online form.The deadline for submissions is : 29 February 2024.Read the full terms and conditions for the Milani patch design contest here.

Hera being prepared for lifting into the LEAF chamber Diego Escorial Olmos, Hera system engineer comments: “Launch will be the single most stressful day of Hera’s life, so we have worked hard to simulate it during our mechanical test phase, first by vibrating the spacecraft on the ESTEC Test Centre’s shaker tables, and now by blasting it with a noise profile sourced from our launch provider, to be as true to life as possible.”The LEAF chamber stands 11 m wide by 9 m deep and 16.4 m high. One of its walls is embedded with a set of enormous sound horns. Nitrogen shot through the horns can produce a range of noise up to more than 154 decibels, like standing close to multiple jets taking off at once. Hera being lifted into LEAF As a safety feature, LEAF can operate only once its doors are closed. Steel-reinforced concrete walls safely contain its noise, which are also coated with epoxy resin to reflect noise to produce a uniform sound field within the chamber. The chamber itself is supported on rubber bearing pads to isolate it from its surroundings, preventing damage to the rest of the Test Centre – or nearby human observers.Hera was switched on for the test sessions, and placed in launch configuration, with its solar wings folded around its body and its fuel tanks filled with helium, nitrogen and water. Ahead of testing it had been fitted with more than 130 accelerometers to chart the forces exerted on it then ringed by microphones to record the surrounding noise levels, to ensure the tests attain their planned volume. Installing Hera in the LEAF for acoustic testing ESA structures engineer Simon Whent, supporting the design of the Hera spacecraft structure and many of its payloads, comments: “Even though this acoustic testing has been exhaustively modelled ahead of time, it was still a nerve-wracking moment as the giant doors of the LEAF chamber close and then the horns are activated. Each test session lasts for just a minute – but that still seemed like a very long time as we waited to find out if Hera’s structure and components withstand the sound waves blasting it.”ESA mechanical systems and structures engineer Cliff Ashcroft, who led the design of Hera’s central tube ‘backbone’, adds: “In reality, the highest, most damaging levels of acoustic pressure are felt during the early launch phase, generated at or close to lift-off, when the vibrations reflected from the pad and local facility bombard the departing launcher. It is a kind of final acoustic ‘pat on the back’ as the launcher and spacecraft depart from Earth.” Hera, her CubeSats, and their rocky target destination Hera is Europe’s contribution to an international planetary defence experiment. Following the DART mission’s impact with the Dimorphos asteroid last year – modifying its orbit and sending a plume of debris thousands of kilometres out into space – Hera will return to Dimorphos to perform a close-up survey of the crater left by DART. The mission will also measure Dimorphos’ mass and make-up, along with that of the larger Didymos asteroid that Dimorphos orbits around.Hera is scheduled for launch in October 2024, to rendezvous with the Didymos and Dimorphos asteroid system about two years later. Hera inside LEAF “The successful completion of Hera’s mechanical test phase sets us well on track to meet that deadline, thanks to the collective dedication of ESA’s Hera team, prime contractor OHB and European Test Services, managing the Test Centre for ESA,” comments Paolo Martino, leading the mission engineering team. “The remainder of this year will see the spacecraft undergoing various functional tests and preparation for its next important testing milestone – sustained operation in space-grade vacuum and temperature extremes within a thermal vacuum chamber, scheduled for early next year, followed by testing of the inter-satellite links that will keep Hera connected to the pair of CubeSats it will deploy in the vicinity of Dimorphos.” The Incredible Adventures of the Hera mission – Testing times Access the video Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Once a week, a satellite or rocket body reenters uncontrolled through our atmosphere. Behaviours in space have to change. Building on a decade of work carried out across the Agency, ESA has introduced its own bold internal standard to significantly limit the production of debris in Earth and Lunar orbits by 2030 for all the Agency''s future missions, programmes and activities: ESA’s ‘Zero Debris approach’.But space exploration is a global endeavour for the shared benefit of humankind, and the long-term sustainability of space will require action and change from all. ESA is facilitating the Zero Debris Charter: a global initiative for all space entities to sign and follow towards the shared goal of a Zero Debris future.After months of intense and fast-paced collective effort, the Zero Debris Charter has been finalised. “As space infrastructure has become the backbone of our modern society, the proliferation of space debris is threatening our way of life. Now is the time to act as a community to channel our collective efforts,” said ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher.“To implement the Zero Debris Charter, ESA will focus on developing ground-breaking technologies for satellite end-of-life disposal, in-orbit servicing and active debris removal. In addition, ESA will work hand-in-hand with institutions in charge of regulatory aspects.” The 2023 Space Summit in Seville marks the opening of the period of registration of intent to sign the Zero Debris Charter.Click here to register Zero Debris by 2030 In 2022, ESA Member States encouraged the Agency to implement “a Zero Debris approach for its missions; and to encourage partners and other actors to pursue similar paths”. ESA is undergoing a profound internal transformation to mitigate the creation of space debris and remedy what''s already up there by 2030, through its Zero Debris approach.From designing and building new missions to flying and responsibly disposing of them, ESA''s Zero Debris approach is seeing a bold new standard that will apply to all ESA missions and partnerships from 2030, with continual advancements and improvements in the years before.But the space debris problem is a global one, and the Zero Debris Charter is the first initiative of its kind to bring together the largest array and variety of space actors around the world with the joint goal of creating no more debris by 2030 and making possible the long-term sustainability of space activities.More than 40 organisations have actively engaged in the open and collaborative development of the Charter, now released and ready for signatures from “any entity demonstrating a strong commitment to advancing space safety and sustainability”: join the Zero Debris Community and play a vital role in shaping the global response to the space debris problem. By gathering a wide array of space entities to define ambitious and measurable space debris mitigation and remediation targets for 2030, the Zero Debris Charter has already: Built a diverse community of actors in Europe and beyond, committed to further advancing space safety and sustainability, including industrial players of all sizes, government agencies, international organisations, universities and research centres, non-profit foundations and more. Developed a precise and common vision of space sustainability for 2030 – combining far-reaching guiding principles and highly ambitious yet realistic technical targets on which to build an ambitious Zero Debris roadmap, driving global space debris mitigation and remediation efforts. “We are delighted that the Charter was finalised on 16 October 2023 and released today, at the occasion of the Space Summit 2023,” explains Quentin Verspieren, Protect Accelerator Coordinator.“Based on a draft proposed by ESA, we have analysed, debated and rewritten every single line of the Charter through a fully open and collaborative process. Beyond having converged on such an ambitious document in record time, our exchanges revealed a strong consensus in Europe and beyond on the need to go further than existing space safety and sustainability practices.” And the Zero Debris Charter is just only the beginning, the starting point for ambitious, collective activities that will build the technologies, new economies and policies required to make Zero Debris a reality.ESA invites any space actor to join the Zero Debris community and help achieve a Zero Debris future by 2030! Join the Zero Debris Community Space actors are invited to register their intent to sign up to the Zero Debris Charter, here. Once interested entities have confirmed their intent, signing ceremonies will be held in the first half of 2024.

For three hours at the very end, a very brief period, it was space debris. This new animation is made from the last eight images ever taken of ESA''s wind-profiling mission, showing it beginning to tumble as it was buffeted by Earth’s atmosphere, during its very brief ‘junk’ phase. In-depth Falling to Earth can take a very long time International regulations on space debris mitigation set a limit on how long a satellite should linger in orbit once its mission is complete – it mustn’t be longer than 25 years.For missions flying at low altitudes, their return is made faster as they are grasped by Earth’s wispy atmosphere and are quickly brought home.During Aeolus’s first-of-its-kind assisted reentry in July, not only was the (already low) risk from falling debris reduced by a factor of 150, but the time during which Aeolus was left uncontrolled in orbit was shortened by a few weeks, limiting the risk of collision with other satellites in this vital space highway. Moving moments Aeolus became debris after the last command was executed at 17:43 CEST on 28 July 2023, after which the Flight Control Team could no longer speak to, hear from, or influence the satellite. After months of preparation and a week of intense and critical operations, the team had done everything they could, the satellite was passivated – turned off – and ‘handed over’ to ESA’s Space Debris Office which tracked its final descent. Right on track: Aeolus reentry map Looking at the ground track, the path on Earth that Aeolus was likely to fly over, it was clear that the Tracking and Imaging Radar (TIRA) at Fraunhofer FHR in Germany would get a good view. Using their 34-m antenna, TIRA tracked Aeolus at around 18:20 CEST for about four minutes. “Spacecraft operators are used to being in a dialogue with their missions, but debris can’t talk. These final observations confirmed that Aeolus’s final burn had gone well and that the now ‘dead’ satellite had gotten into the expected elliptical orbit, with a minimum altitude of 120km,” explains Benjamin Bastida Virgili, expert in ESA’s Space Debris Office.“If you think of Aeolus’s path as a slightly squashed circle, rather than a line, that circle was getting smaller and more circular as it returned, but its altitude would still go up and down. We used this orbit information to compute a new estimate of Aeolus’s reentry time, which occurred just over two hours later and on our planned ground track.” Final images of Aeolus during its brief phase as space debris acquired by the Space Observation Radar TIRA of Fraunhofer FHR. (Note the color represents the radar echo intensity.) This was the last time the mission teams saw Aeolus. Still whole, it was just two hours from falling to pieces in Earth’s atmosphere over Antarctica, far from inhabited regions.At around 20:40 CEST for about two minutes, Aeolus became a fireball – a temporary shooting star in the atmosphere.“Normally, once a mission goes into the nose of its rocket and the fairing closes around it, that’s the last time we expect to ever see it,” says Aeolus Mission Manager Tommaso Parrinello.“With Aeolus, in a remarkable example of sustainable spaceflight and responsible operations, we stayed with the mission for as long as we could, guiding its return as much as it was possible to do, and these images are our final farewell to the mission we all miss, but whose legacy lives on”.

ESA’s asteroid mission for planetary defence was built and prepared in two halves, but now, through a painstaking operation, they have been mated together to make a single spacecraft, ready for full-scale testing of its readiness for space. Hera, her CubeSats, and their rocky target destination The mating took place at OHB Bremen in Germany, with Hera’s Core Module raised more than 3 m above its Propulsion Module then gradually and carefully slotted into place, over a three-hour period. The modules had been placed in cages to ensure their correct alignment relative to each other down to a few tenths of a millimetre.“The mission keeps on hitting milestones right now, but this is a big one, and a very emotional moment for the team,” explains Paolo Martino, Hera system engineer. “Previously we had these two modules, now you can say the spacecraft has been born.” Hubble sees boulders escaping from asteroid Dimorphos Hera is Europe’s contribution to an international planetary defence experiment.

So to maximise working time the mission was constructed by prime contractor OHB as two separate modules, which could be worked on in parallel. Mating Hera: two into one Access the video Hera’s Propulsion Module incorporates its propellant tanks – housed within a central titanium cylinder, the ‘backbone’ of the spacecraft – along with piping and thrusters, which will have the job of hauling the mission across deep space for more than two years, then to manoeuvre around Dimorphos and Didymos.Meanwhile Hera’s Core Module can be thought of as the brains of the mission, hosting its onboard computer, mission systems and instruments. Hera Propulsion Module Manufactured together, the Core Module remained at OHB while the Propulsion Module travelled to Avio near Rome in Italy for the addition of its propulsion system. The pair were then reunited in Bremen to prepare for the mating operation.“A similar double-module process is often used for telecom missions, but those are usually standardised designs,” adds Paolo. “This is the first time it has been applied to a deep space mission, on a much more ad hoc basis.” Hera''s Core Module lowered onto Propulsion Module The mating had been exhaustively simulated in advance using CAD software, but OHB’s assembly, integration and testing team were still checking alignment as the crane lowered the Core Module every step of the way. The cleanroom door was kept sealed during the mating to prevent any distraction.“We studied a lot together with our designers on which were the most critical parts of the process, so most of them were already taken into account,” explains Matteo Grimaldi, Senior Assembly, Integration and Testing technician at OHB. Complete Hera spacecraft Once the tip of the Propulsion Module cylinder met the top deck of the Core Module the mating was complete.

The object is a 113 kg, two-metre-diameter, conical upper portion of a payload adapter associated with the VV02 Vega launch that delivered the Proba-V, VNREDSat-1 and ESTCube-1 satellites into Earth orbit.The new debris is believed to originate from the VESPA adapter, which is in an orbit with perigee at 660 km altitude, apogee at 790 km and an inclination of 98.72 degrees. This payload adapter is the subject of the upcoming ClearSpace-1 active space debris removal (ADR) mission. It is being developed as the first-ever mission to remove an existing derelict object from orbit through highly precise and complex, close-proximity and capture operations.ESA procured the Clearspace-1 mission as a service from the Swiss start-up ‘ClearSpace’ in order to demonstrate the technologies needed for debris removal and as a first step to establishing a new, sustainable and striving commercial space ecosystem. The information currently available indicates that the most likely cause of the event was the hypervelocity impact of a small, untracked object that resulted in a low-energy release of new fragments. A preliminary assessment indicates that the increased collision risk to other missions posed by these fragments is negligible.The US 18th Space Defense Squadron has conducted further tracking, and the TIRA system of the Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques in Germany and the Polish “European Optical Network” members (under ESA contract) have also conducted independent observations. These observations indicate that the main object remains intact and has experienced no significant alteration to its orbit. The development of the ClearSpace-1 mission will continue as planned while additional data on the event is collected. ESA and industrial partners are carefully evaluating the event’s impact on the mission. A full analysis will last for several weeks.This fragmentation event underlines the relevance of the ClearSpace-1 mission. The most significant threat posed by larger objects of space debris is that they fragment into clouds of smaller objects that can each cause significant damage to active satellites. To minimise the number of fragmentation events, we must urgently reduce the creation of new space debris and begin actively mitigating the impact of existing objects.

The measures described in the guidelines set out how to design, fly, and dispose of space missions in ways that prevent the creation of further debris. They were a major step for the protection of our important orbits and have served as the baseline for space policy, national legislation and technical standards for two decades.Since 2016, ESA’s Space Debris Office has published an annual Space Environment Report to provide a transparent overview of global space activities and determine how well these and other international debris-reduction measures are improving the long-term sustainability of spaceflight.Below is an overview of the 2023 report. The basics Earth’s orbital environment is a finite resource. More satellites were launched in 2022 than in any year before. The number and scale of commercial satellite constellations in certain, economically valuable low-Earth orbits continues to increase. Not enough satellites leave these heavily congested orbits at the end of their lives. Satellites that remain in their operational orbit at the end of their mission are at risk of fragmenting into dangerous clouds of debris that linger in orbit for many years. Active satellites must perform an increasing number of collision avoidance manoeuvres to dodge out of the way of other satellites and fragments of space debris. The adoption of space debris mitigation measures is improving, but, given the sheer number of new satellites and amount of existing debris, the rate is still not enough and our behaviour in space appears to be unsustainable in the long term. In-depth Continuing trends Space Environment Report 2023 - Figure 1 The number of new satellites launched continues to increase year-on-year2409 new, tracked ‘payloads’ (primarily satellites) entered orbit around Earth in 2022, more than ever before. Space Environment Report 2023 - Figure 2 Most new satellites are heading to similar orbitsSpace may be unfathomably large, but the regions with economic value can be shockingly small.The number of new satellites launched last year was dominated almost entirely by those establishing or expanding commercial satellite constellations in low-Earth orbits.These constellations are launched to provide services such as global communications, but only a narrow band of orbits are suitable for these purposes.As a result, a collision or fragmentation in these orbital regions would be catastrophic for the rest of the satellites in similar orbits, and for satellites or crewed space vehicles passing through this region on their way to more distant destinations. Space Environment Report 2023 - Figure 3 These orbits are the most hazardousOf the more than 30 000 individual pieces of space debris larger than 10 cm currently identified, more than half of them litter low-Earth orbit (below 2000 km).This does not include objects that haven’t yet been tracked, or those currently too small to track. Based on ESA models, the total number of objects in Earth orbit larger than 1 cm in size is likely over one million. Space Environment Report 2023 - Figure 4 However, due to increasing launch traffic, the average satellite in an orbit below 600 km is actually more likely to have to take evasive action to avoid a collision with another satellite than with a piece of debris.A possible collision with another operational satellite may be easier to avoid, as, typically, both objects are manoeuvrable, but this requires good coordination and an exchange of data between operators to ensure there are no misunderstandings.At higher altitudes, satellites are most at risk of colliding with a fragment of debris that resulted from one of a small handful of well-known break up events. New insights Space Environment Report 2023 - Figure 5 A record number of objects reenter Earth’s atmosphereA record number of human-made objects fell from space in 2022. This was driven by a large number of falling ‘payload fragments’ (PF), mostly resulting from an anti-satellite test performed in orbit.However, last year also saw a record number of satellites reenter Earth’s atmosphere. Space Environment Report 2023 - Figure 6 An increasing number of satellites comply with international guidelinesThe rising number of reentries is not necessarily a bad thing. Disposing of satellites efficiently is one of the most important things for keeping low-Earth orbits safe.Space debris mitigation guidelines state that satellites should vacate protected orbits within 25 years after their use has come to an end. This image shows how compliance with this guideline is improving for different types of satellite. Early constellation satellites had very low compliance, for example, while the compliance of those launched this decade is almost 100 %. Space Environment Report 2023 - Figure 7 That means reentry numbers are likely to continue to riseOver 80 % of constellation satellites launched in 2022 were inserted into orbits from which they will decay towards Earth in less than two years once they are no longer operational or if they lose propulsion. The increasing number of satellites reentering Earth’s atmosphere is therefore expected to continue in coming years.Most non-constellation satellites are inserted into orbits from which the natural decay would occur in less than the maximum of 25 years stipulated by international guidelines and standards. In practice, the introduction of these guidelines has seen orbital activities shift to lower altitudes when compared to 10 years ago. Space Environment Report 2023 - Figure 8 Most reentries are uncontrolled… for nowHowever, most objects reenter in an uncontrolled manner: they are switched off at the end of their mission and left to fall and burn up in Earth’s atmosphere.This helps to keep orbits clear of inactive space junk, but the owner has no control over where in Earth’s skies it will break up and where any surviving fragments will land.Advancing technology, increasing reusability and the implementation and adherence to sustainability guidelines has seen a recent increase in “controlled reentries” for rocket bodies. A controlled reentry allows operators to remove their hardware from protected regions more quickly and with greater control over where, when and how it reenters – and even lands – at the cost of allocating some fuel to do so.If space debris mitigation guidelines become stricter in the coming years, satellites may also have to vacate protected regions more quickly than they do today and in an even safer manner. One way of achieving this is designing the satellite to perform a controlled reentry at the end of its mission.But just because an older satellite wasn’t designed to be controlled during its descent through the atmosphere doesn’t mean it’s impossible to do so. In July 2023, teams at ESA’s ESOC mission control attempted a new way of assisting a reentry for an older satellite that can make them safer.The ESA teams carried out the first “assisted reentry” of its kind as they guided the Agency’s Aeolus satellite to burn up over uninhabited regions in the Atlantic and Antarctica, even though the satellite was designed in the late 1990s with no intention to control it in this way. Outlook Time to Act Access the video Space is becoming increasingly useful, valuable and even essential to modern society. But we must ensure that it is not just the benefits that we extract from orbit, but also the waste.Large pieces of space debris pose two types of risk: the short-term risk that they may collide directly with an active satellite, and the long-term risk that they may break down into a cloud of smaller pieces, each threatening to catastrophically damage a satellite.Even if we launched nothing from now on, collisions among the space debris objects already in orbit would cause the problem to get worse.Long term, increasing space activity could lead to “Kessler Syndrome” – the situation in which the density of objects in orbit is high enough that collisions between objects and debris create a cascade effect, each crash generating debris that then increases the likelihood of further collisions. At this point, certain low-Earth orbits will become entirely inhospitable. So, what are doing about it?Based on the findings of ESA’s yearly report and other studies, there is a growing consensus that we need stricter space debris mitigation practices.ESA has recently introduced a Zero Debris approach, with the aim of ensuring the Agency’s activities generate no new space debris in valuable orbits by 2030.The approach encompasses a number of developments related to Agency policy, technological advances and satellite operations that will strongly limit the generation of space debris.For older pieces of debris, the only solution is “active debris removal”. ESA is purchasing the ClearSpace-1 mission as a service from the Swiss start-up ‘Clearspace SA’ to demonstrate the technologies needed for active debris removal and as a first step to establishing a new and sustainable commercial sector dedicated to removing high-risk objects from our valuable and limited orbital highways.ClearSpace-1 will be the first mission to remove a piece of space debris from orbit. The spacecraft will rendezvous with, capture and safely bring down a 112 kg defunct rocket part, launched in 2013, for a safe atmospheric reentry.Just like with the reentry of Aeolus, ESA seeks to demonstrate that a more sustainable approach is possible, even in challenging circumstances. The Agency hopes that by leading by example, it can encourage other space operators and manufacturers to adopt similar practices for the better of all.

IPAG and our project partners will be following the process of integration, especially in terms of connection with the rest of the CubeSat, to optimise the performance of the finished instrument, and to calibrate its performance to ensure we interpret our science data as best we can once we are in space. Hera, her CubeSats, and their rocky target destination “Looking ahead, we will also be working on our operating procedures, to try out how we will be operating the instrument in practice, including hardware-in-the-loop testing where we will be commanding the radar via Hera and its CubeSat down on the ground.”Scheduled to fly to the Didymos binary asteroid system with ESA’s Hera mission for planetary defence in 2024, the compact radar aboard the Juventas CubeSat will perform the first ever radar sounding inside an asteroid. Juventas will peer up to 100 m deep within the 160-m-diameter Dimorphos moonlet of the 780-m-diameter Didymos asteroid. Juventas CubeSat model in Hertz test chamber CubeSats are mini-satellites built up from standardised 10-cm boxes. Juventas is a ‘6-unit’ CubeSat, measuring 10x20x30 cm, while the Juventas radar instrument – JuRa – for short measures 9.5x9.5x9.5 cm across, able to fit within a single CubeSat unit, along with a quartet of 1.5 m-long radar antennas – which will deploy like metal tape measures and have been manufactured by Astronika in Poland.JuRa’s radar electronics are the responsibility of EmTroniX in Luxembourg, a company that initially developed automotive electronics before expanding into designing and producing payloads and avionics for ‘New Space’ missions. JuRA radar packaging “It feels good to deliver something to our customer, but it will feel even better once everything is fully integrated and tested,” comments Cedric Lorant, EmTroniX co-founder and CEO.“Once JuRa is integrated with the rest of the Juventas CubeSat, and we perform remaining tweaks such as re-flashing it to the latest firmware, then we will assess how the instrument performs within its working environment.”Planned to perform at least 45 hours of operations during the two-month working life of Juventas, JuRa incorporates some of the latest electronic components, but they had to undergo painstaking radiation testing ahead of delivery to ESA, because the space beyond Earth orbit is riven with charged particles that can degrade electronics. Rosetta mission selfie at comet The JuRa radar design – developed in IPAG in partnership with the Chair for Radio Frequency and Photonics Engineering of Technical University Dresden – is derived from a previous space radar flown on ESA’s Rosetta mission, which plumbed the depths of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.IPAG has also worked on radar systems for other space missions including NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and ESA’s Juice. Juventas studies asteroid''s internal structure “JuRa is a small, low-frequency, radar for a small body, compared to the bigger instruments we have put together for planetary targets,” adds Alain. “As with Rosetta around 67P, we take advantage of the fact we will be orbiting relatively slowly around the Dimorphos asteroid.”Hera will be moving at a few metres per second around the asteroid. This means JuRa can compensate for its comparative lack of power by transmitting the same signal multiple times, boosting its overall signal to noise ratio. The signal is specifically encoded to support the disentangling of radar returns, harnessing an EmTroniX-designed software-defined radio digital signal processor. Drone test of Hera mission asteroid radar The full depth of radar penetration of JuRa’s 60 MHz signal will depend on the consistency of Dimorphos. A more homogeneous interior will allow deeper sounding compared to a discontinuous rubble pile structure with big monoliths interspersed with empty voids.The JuRa team has also been in discussion with ESA and other space agencies about the prospect of flying JuRa units to other asteroids, potentially including targeting the 2029 Earth flyby of the Apophis asteroid.

Last September NASA’s DART mission returned images of the boulder-strewn Dimorphos moonlet just before impacting it, in an audacious and ultimately successful attempt to shift its orbit around its parent asteroid Didymos.Following on from DART, Hera will carry with it a pair of shoebox-sized ‘CubeSats’ that conclude their own observations by landing on Dimorphos. Team members have been using DART images to help visualise this process of touchdown. And in the process they can''t help but imagine: what would it be like for human explorers to one day follow in these CubeSats’ footsteps? Hera, her CubeSats, and their rocky target destination Rocky horror “The boulders covering the surface of Dimorphos are much bigger than they might look,” says planetary scientist Naomi Murdoch of ISAE-Supaero in France, working on the CubeSat landings. “At around 5-7 m across, the largest ones are typically house-sized.”This assemblage of outsize rocks is a possible clue to the formation of Dimorphos. Its parent asteroid Didymos might well have spun sufficiently fast at some point in its past that material was flung off to collect in orbit. Supporting this theory, Didymos is shaped like a spinning top, with portions of its surface appearing swept clear of boulders. Hypothetical human mission to an asteroid Naomi explains: “Moving across these boulders would likely involve much more climbing and jumping than walking. Be careful though - jump too fast and you might never come down again, because you could exceed the local escape velocity. Plus in the ultra-low gravity environment it would be easy to generate significant ground motion, potentially triggering an avalanche of rocks.”Sink or shootPatrick Michel, Director of de Research at Observatoire de la Côte d''Azur and Hera’s Principal Investigator adds: “A lot depends on whether its material is hard or soft, which would determine how high an astronaut might bounce, or else sink. On the asteroid Bennu, visited by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx, you would clearly sink if you landed too hard. On a harder body just 6 cm per second of upward motion might be enough to send you into orbit.” NASA''s OSIRIS-REx probe touches Bennu asteroid Dimorphos, at 160 m across is about the same size as the Great Pyramid of Giza, orbiting around the mountain sized Didymos asteroid, about 780-m across. DART’s impact with the Dimorphos asteroid shifted its orbit around Didymos as well as casting debris thousands of kilometres across space. The current estimate is that about 1 000 tonnes of debris were blasted away, enough to fill 60 train carriages. Next, in October 2024, ESA’s Hera mission will begin its own journey to Dimorphos, to gather close-up data including the size of the impact crater and the asteroid’s mineral make-up and mass.Hera will also deploy two ''6-unit'' CubeSats for additional observations: Juventas will perform the first radar probe of an asteroid’s interior while Milani will carry out mineral prospecting with its hyperspectral imager. Both CubeSats are also equipped with instruments to gather surface data once they land: Juventas has a gravimeter to make gravity field measurements while both Juventas and Milani have accelerometers to acquire details of their likely initial bounces, to reconstruct surface characteristics. How DART impacted Dimorphos Designing for ultra-low gravityThe CubeSat deployment has been designed around the fundamental fact that Dimorphos’s gravity levels are less than a millionth of Earth’s. So the pair will be released from Hera at a velocity of just a few centimetres per second – any faster and they would risk escaping the asteroid’s feeble gravity and being lost in space. The MINERVA lander of Japan’s Hayabusa mission was lost in a similar manner when it was deployed in the wrong direction, as it attempted to land on the Itokawa asteroid in 2005.Accordingly, any human astronaut would probably either use spikes and crampons to anchor themselves onto the surface, or else a thruster unit to glide over the surface – like a scuba diver exploring a coral reef. Milani studies asteroid dust “You would want to avoid contact with surface rocks while gliding however, as they are likely to be sharp enough to snag your spacesuit, having never been smoothed by water or wind,” says Naomi. “Adding to the challenge, your weight would shift by about 10-20% depending on where you are on the surface, because of tidal forces from the Didymos parent asteroid.”Navigation would present another difficulty, comments Patrick: “It is likely Dimorphos was tidally locked before DART’s impact, but is now probably either rotating or ‘librating’ – wobbling – as it orbits Didymos.” Either way, this means the local sky above an exploring astronaut would probably be shifting all the time, and disorientation might become a risk. Juventas lands on Didymos Short but useful surface lifetimeHera’s CubeSats will first carry out their primary missions – steering around Dimorphos using cold gas thrusters – before touching down on the asteroid. Juventas’s gravimeter has been designed to operate on the surface independently of its orientation on landing: assuming for instance it falls upside down, or between boulders, it will go on working for the approximately 20-hour lifetime of its battery. Milani’s accelerometers will record the force of its bounces as it comes down to the surface, gathering further data on the weak gravity field of Dimorphos. Results from both CubeSats will be gathered by Hera via its inter-satellite links. Hera is due to be launched in October 2024, to arrive at Didymos and Dimorphos just over two years later.

The latest instrument being prepared for ESA’s Hera mission for planetary defence will observe its target Dimorphos asteroid in a range of colours far beyond the limits of the human eye. In the process Hera’s HyperScout H hyperspectral imager will help prospect the asteroid’s mineral makeup – in the process helping to deduce how best to deflect future asteroids which might one day endanger Earth. HyperScout H inspection Around the size of a shoebox, HyperScout H is the newest design in a family of hyperspectral imagers developed for Earth observation and planetary science by cosine Remote Sensing in the Netherlands. HyperScout H has undergone a formal ‘key inspection point’ for flight aboard ESA’s Hera mission, which is due to be launched in October 2024.A team of experts from ESA and cosine performed an inspection of the HyperScout H flight unit in cosine’s cleanroom in Sassenheim, the Netherlands. Didymos and Dimorphos seen by DART Hannah Goldberg, ESA’s Hera system manager, explains: “The next step is environmental testing of the instrument, which takes place at ESA’s Mechanical Systems Laboratory in our nearby ESTEC technical centre. We are harnessing their wide range of testing capabilities to verify that HyperScout H can endure the conditions that Hera will experience in space.”Hera is Europe’s contribution to an international planetary defence experiment. Following the DART mission’s impact with the Dimorphos asteroid last year – modifying its orbit and sending a plume of debris thousands of kilometres out into space – Hera will return to Dimorphos to perform a close-up survey of the crater left by DART. The mission will also measure Dimorphos’ mass and make-up, along with that of the larger Didymos asteroid that Dimorphos orbits around. Post-impact ejecta from asteroid HyperScout H will contribute to that goal by gathering crucial mineralogical data to help scientists and future mission planners better understand asteroid compositions and structures.“Having hyperspectral measurements can significantly contribute to our characterisation of asteroids,” comments Paolo Martino, ESA Hera Deputy Mission Manager. “Specific to the Hera mission, it will help us determine the composition of the asteroid. “We are visiting an asteroid that has received an impact from NASA’s DART mission, which has generated a crater with a huge distribution of material. Having hyperspectral measurements will help us understand exactly the dynamic of the impact. This is fundamental for the modeling of the physics of the impact, and therefore to understand the technique of impacting and deflecting asteroids and how we can use it in the future in case of need.”The technology is already proven in space: HyperScout 2 flew aboard ESA’s GomX-4B CubeSat in 2018, delivering hyperspectral 200 x 150 km views of Earth. An updated HyperScout 2 incorporating onboard AI processing and a new thermal infrared channel was launched on the FSSCAT CubeSat in 2020. HyperScout view of Netherlands Marco Esposito, Remote Sensing Managing Director of cosine explains that while the HyperScout instrument has been employed for Earth observation, it originated in the planetary science realm: “We looked, together with ESA, at missions to Jupiter, Mercury and Venus, where hyperspectral measurements helped characterise aspects of these planets. Starting from there we developed HyperScout in collaboration with ESA’s Directorates of Technology, Engineering and Quality and Earth Observation, and we now have a good market share for this type of instruments and applications.“HyperScout is a perfect instrument to help us with early detection and warning, enabling us to act fast and prevent major catastrophes resulting from events such as wildfires and flooding. In addition, HyperScout can help solve environmental challenges, such as climate change and the resulting adaptation of plants. HyperScout H placed in test chamber “We are really honored to become an integral part of ESA’s Hera mission and expect more planetary science missions in the future, since many private parties are looking into such missions, for example for asteroid mining.”Pierluigi Foglia Manzillo, cosine''s project manager for HyperScout H, adds: “The test readiness of the HyperScout H flight model comes after multiple years of cosine activity in the context of the Hera mission. We designed and developed a hyperspectral payload which fully exploits its flight heritage in the context of Earth observation and has been adapted to the environmental and performance requirements of an interplanetary mission. The outcome is a compact and high-performance instrument that will greatly contribute to reaching the Hera science goals.“I am proud of leading a large team of talented professionals who made this success happen and I would like to express my gratitude for their hard work and dedication. We now confidently look forward to the instrument test phase and to its integration in the Hera spacecraft."

Two complete and fully tested Asteroid Framing Cameras have reached OHB in Germany for integration aboard Hera’s payload module. This instrument will provide the very first star-like view of Hera’s target for the mission to steer towards the Dimorphos asteroid, which last year had its orbit altered by an impact with NASA’s DART mission. Asteroid Framing Camera “It is a huge milestone to have the very first Hera payload ready for integration onto the spacecraft,” comments Hannah Goldberg, Hera system engineer. “And the Asteroid Framing Camera, AFC, is not only our first payload, but also the most important, since by itself it can obtain all the mission’s core goals. Hera payloads are arranged with core and opportunity objectives in mind – based firstly on the data we have to acquire, then the secondary results we seek to obtain whenever possible. “Our October 2024 launch date is creeping ever closer, but the mission subsystems are beginning to come together as planned. So the next time we’ll see these cameras will be aboard the complete Hera flight model when overall spacecraft testing begins this autumn.” Post-impact ejecta extending into space Hera is Europe’s contribution to an international planetary defence experiment. Following the DART mission’s impact with the Dimorphos asteroid last year – modifying its orbit and sending a plume of debris thousands of kilometres out into space – Hera will return to Dimorphos to perform a close-up survey of the crater left by DART. The mission will also measure Dimorphos’ mass and make-up, along with that of the larger Didymos asteroid that Dimorphos orbits around.Operated on a redundant basis – meaning one unit will be kept in reserve in case of failure – the AFC will play a pivotal role in Hera’s mission. As well as acquiring detailed views of the surface of Dimorphos for scientific analysis, including the crater left by the DART impact, the AFC will also be used for guidance, navigation and control. Hera scans DART’s impact crater The AFC will home in on Dimorphos when it is still a single point of light in the sky – seen in conjunction with the larger asteroid Didymos. The AFC will then transition to close-up navigation, utilising edge detection to keep the asteroid centered in its field of view while tracking surface features to derive Hera’s exact position from the asteroid in a similar manner to self-driving car software.Around the same size and shape as a household vase, the 1.3 kg AFC has been designed, manufactured and tested by Jena-Optronik in Germany. The compact design with its long baffle to protect the camera’s optics from sunglare shares heritage with the startracker units that Jena-Optronik specialises in – utilised to map the stars around a spacecraft in order to pinpoint its position in space. Didymos and Dimorphos seen by DART Steffen Schwarz, Head of Marketing & Sales at Jena-Optronik, comments: “Hera is a prestigious mission and we at Jena-Optronik are looking forward to make a decisive contribution to its success through our camera.”Possessing a 5.5 degree field of view, the monochromatic AFC acquires images using complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor active pixel sensor (CMOS APS) technology – an advanced, rad-hardened version of the imaging used in modern smartphone cameras – the FaintStar2 detector chip marketed by Caeleste in Belgium, initially designed for startrackers through a project in ESA''s General Support Technology Programme. DART''s moment of impact “The images we will see from the AFC will resemble those returned by DART before its impact,” adds Hannah. “For example, the picture we saw of the two asteroids together in DART’s field of view, and then later on the boulder-strewn surface of Dimorphos as DART was about to collide.“The AFC’s images will be complemented by colour images from other instruments, including Hera’s HyperScout instrument which will see in 25 different colours and the ASPECT hyperspectral imager aboard the Milani CubeSat, whose vision will extend beyond visible light into the infrared.” Other Hera subsystems are currently being finalised: Hera’s laser-based PALT (Planetary Altimeter) coming from Portugal; the HyperScout2 imager from the Netherlands; the Milani CubeSat from Italy and the Juventas CubeSat from Luxembourg; and the TIRI thermal imager contributed by Japan.

Hidden in the glare of our Sun are an unknown number of asteroids on paths we cannot track, many of which could be heading for Earth, and we just don’t know it. ESA’s planned NEOMIR mission will be located between Earth and the Sun and will act as an early warning system for asteroids 20 metres and larger that cannot be seen from the ground. In-depth Predicting Chelyabinsk No one saw the Chelyabinsk meteor of 15 February 2013 coming. Just after sunrise on a calm and sunny winter’s day, a 20-metre asteroid struck the atmosphere over the Ural Mountains in Russia, at a speed of more than 18 km/s. Tunguska devastation The relatively small rock approached Earth from very near the direction of the Sun, exploding in the atmosphere and creating a shockwave that damaged thousands of buildings, breaking windows and injuring roughly 1500 people from flying shards of glass. It was the largest asteroid to strike Earth in over a century. Statistically, asteroids this size strike Earth about once every 50-100 years. Larger asteroids are far less common but – just ask the dinosaurs – do a great deal more damage. These are, fortunately, much easier to detect. Infographic: asteroid danger explained In fact, we have discovered almost all asteroids larger than 1 km in size. Small and medium-sized asteroids are more common, and can still do great damage, but warning times of a few days can be enough for local authorities to notify the public to keep away from windows or even to evacuate a local area. With NEOMIR, we’ll be prepared Whether it’s preparing for a mission to deflect a large asteroid years in advance or providing the data for local authorities to keep communities informed of airbursts weeks ahead, ESA’s NEOMIR will fill a gap in our current asteroid detection capabilities. Lagrange points are locations in space where the gravitational pull from the Earth equals the pull from the Sun, and satellites can reside with less ‘orbital mainentence’ than those orbiting Earth or flying out to deep space.] Asteroids are visible because they reflect the Sun’s light, which we can detect from Earth. However, the closer they get to the Sun, the harder they are to see. Asteroids crossing the face of the Sun are particularly difficult to detect, but from Earth we are also blind to asteroids near the Sun as they are outshone by its glare. ESA’s upcoming NEOMIR mission will be launched into orbit around the first Lagrange point (L1) between the Sun and Earth, remaining in the same position relative to the two bodies. This will give the telescope a view of asteroids that may come towards the Earth from the direction of the Sun. NEOMIR - in-orbit asteroid spotter Being situated outside of Earth’s distorting atmosphere and with a telescope observing in infrared light, NEOMIR will monitor a close ring around the Sun that is impossible to observe from the ground. The mission will detect asteroids passing between Earth and the Sun – any that pose a threat and that we cannot currently see will have to pass through this ring. Here comes the Sun By making observations in the infrared part of the light spectrum, NEOMIR will detect the heat emitted by asteroids themselves, which isn’t drowned out by sunlight. This thermal emission is absorbed by Earth''s atmosphere, but from space NEOMIR will be able to see closer to the Sun than we can currently from Earth. Asteroids 20 metres and larger that are heading toward Earth should be detected by NEOMIR at least three weeks in advance. In the worst-case scenario, in which the asteroid is spotted passing near the spacecraft, we would get a minimum of three days’ warning – the fastest the asteroid could move from L1 to Earth. Current status Artist''s view of the configuration of Ariane 6 using four boosters (A64) Details of the Space Safety Programme''s NEOMIR mission are currently being fleshed out and it is planned to be launched around 2030 with an Ariane 6-2 rocket. An initial study to assess the feasibility of the NEOMIR mission was conducted by ESA''s Concurrent Design Facility in the Netherlands, in 2021. The study focused on defining a mission that would complement NASA''s NEO Surveyor mission. The US-funded mission should fulfil the US Congress mandate to discover 90% of near-Earth objects larger than 140-metres in diameter, while NEOMIR is designed to focus on imminent impactors of any size. NEOMIR is currently early mission study phase. It will require a half-metre telescope with a large, corrected focal plane, as well as two infrared channels covering light in the 5-10 micrometre waveband. Asteroid collision The required detector technologies and associated electronics for this novel mission are currently under development. Industrial research and development projects are planned as supporting activities in parallel. The requirements will be to deliver a similar performance to the ‘NEO Surveyor detectors’, i.e., Teledyne''s HxRG, which are in use in the James Webb Space Telescope (NIRSpec) and ESA’s Euclid (NISP) and Ariel missions, although at shorter wavelengths.

At billions of years old and not seen since Neanderthals roamed, the green comet continues to intrigue as it grows an apparent third tail and unexpectedly – but intriguingly – failed to wow scientists when observed in x-ray light.Grab a pair of (good) binoculars and under dark skies look toward the celestial north pole over the next few days, for a chance to witness a beautiful piece of space history. In-depth Comets continue to captivate “All comets indeed give evidence … of a lot of bad luck, affliction, peril and danger” wrote German author Thomas Hartmann in 1606, reflecting the fact that for a long time comets were deemed to be bad omens. Today, they are evidence of a lot, from the origin of the Solar System to life on Earth. On 1 Feb, Comet ZTF will make its close approach of Earth at about 42 million km (almost a third of the distance between us and the Sun), likely to never return “We know of almost four thousand ‘home-grown’ comets that formed, like the planets, in the leftover cloud of swirling gas and dust that fell in on itself to form our Sun,” explains Marco Micheli, Astronomer in ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.“118 of these are currently classified as ‘near-Earth comets’, and they’re being monitored closely as their orbit brings them across Earth’s own.”Made up of dust, rock and ice, these "dirty snowballs" are the most pristine and untouched objects you can find, having changed very little over billions of years and so offering a window back to the forming of the Solar System. It is also thought that at least some of the water on Earth originated in comets that impacted our planet in its early years.Not only does their chemical composition reveal a great deal, but just 70 years ago the motion of their tails revealed the presence of the solar wind. Supersonic solar wind The solar wind is a fast and constant stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of the Sun, the corona. This wind consists of various particles and elements, including electrons, protons and alpha particles – consisting of two protons and two neutrons – as well as tiny amounts of more complex atomic nuclei such as carbon, oxygen and magnesium. In the 1950s, inspired by discussions with colleagues on the nature of comet tails, the solar physicist Eugene Parker came up with the idea of a constant wind emanating from the Sun.At the time of Parker’s revelation, everyone thought the space between the planets in the Solar System was almost empty. Parker''s idea was very controversial, not only because it meant that the Sun could run out of mass, but also because his (correct) calculations meant the solar wind was supersonic. Comet Swift-Tuttle is responsible for the annual Perseids meteor shower As well as having tails, comets leave a trail of debris particles along their orbit that can span many millions of kilometres and linger for thousands, even millions of years.As Earth orbits the Sun, it frequently flies through this debris (also left by asteroids), and as the matter burns up in our atmosphere it ‘falls’ creating regular meteor showers. How many tails do you see? Look closely, and you’ll spot that comets have two tails, one made of ionised gas and another of dust. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes volatile materials within the comet to vaporise into gas and stream out of the nucleus – the comet’s ‘head’ – carrying dust away with them. Look at images of comets where the Sun is also visible, and you’ll see that their tail is not streaming in the opposite direction of travel, as we may expect on Earth, but away from the Sun. A comet moving away from our star will have a tail outstretched in front of it! In the dust tail, large grains scatter the sun’s light in all directions, some of which is detected by cameras and telescopes on Earth – like the moon and planets.In the ion tail, molecules are much smaller but glow through a process called ‘fluorescence’: ionised atoms and molecules in the gas are struck by photons of light which they absorb, becoming ‘excited’. They then spontaneously re-emit photons at another wavelength, in a different colour, depending on the molecule.Comet ZTF''s bright green glow reveals the chemicals it is made up of, with dicarbon dominating emissions in this part of the visible spectrum. Comet ZTF''s rare "anti-tail" points toward the sun. It is in fact all part of the dust tail, seen ''face on'' from Earth “The two tails point in slightly different directions because the forces act on dust and ions in different ways. While the larger dust particles are pushed by pressure from sunlight, the ions are much lighter and electrically charged so are easily carried by the solar wind and its magnetic field,” explains Jorge Amaya from ESA’s Space Weather Office.“Recently, a strange phenomenon has occurred with comet ZTF as it appears to have a third tail. This is, in fact, an optical illusion, due to our point of view of the dust trail.” Disappointment to intrigue XMM-Newton Many ESA missions have been observing Comet ZTF, even those not focussed on Solar System science. XMM-Newton is one of them, one of the most powerful X-ray telescopes ever placed into orbit.Scientists had expected it to be one of the brightest comets observed, because of its bright green hue. Disappointingly at first, but then intriguingly, the comet barely showed up in the X-rays. While no stunning images were produced, the results are scientifically very valuable. Try to see it During close approach comet ZTF will appear near the north celestial pole, currently about ten degrees away from the bright star Polaris. By the end of this week, it will be more than 30 degrees from the North Star.The best visibility will be with a good pair of binoculars, with which it should appear as a fuzzy colourless object, (only photographic cameras register its peculiar green colour). If very lucky and under extremely dark skies, it will be visible with the naked eye.Comets don’t pass by Earth very often, so catch Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) now, before it departs our Solar System for good.

Our Christmas asteroid, 2015 RN35, poses no threat, but like many middle-sized space rocks out there, we just don’t know that much about it. In-depth 2015 RN35 will make a safe close approach of Earth at 08:12 UTC (09:12 CET) on 15 December, passing by at 686 000 km – just under two lunar distances. Observers in the Southern hemisphere will get the best view during close approach, but Europe will get a chance over the following days until about 19 December. From 15-17 December, 2015 RN35 will have a visual magnitude below 14. (For reference, Pluto has a visual magnitude of 14). Telescopes 30 cm and larger should be able to detect our Christmas asteroid – we look forward to seeing your observations! Use the hashtag #ESAChristmasAsteroid on social media to share your results, which we will share on our @esaoperations channel. ESA''s Christmas asteroid will flyby Earth on 15 December A perfectly ordinary asteroid - probably Risky asteroids: how close do they come? We don’t call this a challenge for no reason. 2015 RN35 will not shine bright in the skies like the star of Bethlehem did millennia ago. No. Smaller than the statue of liberty this asteroid is pretty little on astronomical scales. And as flybys go, at just under two times the distance to the Moon, it’s not likely to make newspaper headlines (although, you never know. Sigh.)So why is 2015 RN35 interesting? Firstly, there’s not a single asteroid out there that isn’t. Near-Earth asteroids fascinate ESA’s Planetary Defence Office in particular because they give us key insights into the composition and trajectory of potentially hazardous objects. Infographic: asteroid danger explained Secondly, this asteroid isn’t well known. We don’t know what it’s made of or precisely how big it is or if it’s spinning on its axis or even know its orbit particularly well. (Enough to know it won’t strike in the next century!).This uncertainty makes it like hundreds of thousands of similarly sized asteroids out there. While we’ve found nearly all of the huge planet-killers, most of these middle-sized asteroids – of which there are several hundred thousand, and which could do great damage to a local area if they were to impact – are yet to be discovered. Catch an asteroid with ESA’s asteroid toolkit Earth in orbit with asteroids on ESA''s ''risk list'', using ESA''s asteroid orbit visualisation tool ESA’s asteroid toolkit has been created by the Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC), based in Rome.“We use these tools every day to plan our observations, to visualise asteroid close approaches and to help us understand and explain the varied asteroid populations in the Solar System and the risk we face,” explains Juan-Luis Cano, Information System Manager at the NEOCC. Aten asteroids in orbit, with ESA''s orbit visualisation tool “We want them to be as useful to the rest of the world as they are to us, because Planetary Defence is a global effort.”With the new near-Earth object (NEO) Toolkit you can visualise the Christmas asteroid’s orbit and its 15 December flyby, including when it will be visible from different locations on Earth, find out more about the Apollo group of asteroids it belongs to and of course, plan your observations from exactly where you are in the world. Freely available via neo.ssa.esa.int/neo-toolkit, the tools are for professional and amateur astronomers alike, along with journalists, media and schools looking for accurate visuals and anyone with an interest in asteroids.The NEO Toolkit includes the Observation Planning Tool, Sky Chart Display Tool, Orbit Visualisation Tool and the Flyby Visualisation Tool.For help using the Toolkit, check out our guide. Share with #ESAChristmasAsteroid If you manage to spot it, share your observations on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or Reddit with the hashtag #ESAChristmasAsteroid, along with a little information about yourself and your location. We can’t wait to see your little dots and trails that, probably, wont make it onto mobile and computer screensavers, but do signify ancient remnants of the early Solar System, and vitally are the bread and butter of planetary defence around the globe. DART asteroid impact impresses in ESA’s view from the ground Access the video “This is the kind of work ESA’s NEOCC does every day, often with even dimmer asteroids using even larger telescopes, such as the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) and others in the NEOCC’s network of rapid-access telescopes spread all over the globe,” explains Richard Moissl, ESA’s Head of Planetary Defence.“With these observations, we determine the motion of asteroids and project their path into the future, in order to know if – when – an asteroid could strike. As the recent DART impact showed, and as ESA’s Hera mission will expand on, with enough warning an asteroid impact is the only natural disaster we can prevent.”If you miss this close approach, you can always look for the next one on 27 December with similar visibility, 2010 XC15.

In-depth The 375m Apophis was briefly an object of concern when in 2004 it appeared to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth on 13 April 2029. Later observations ruled this out entirely. It will however pass very close to Earth, and will be visible around the globe. With the new near-Earth object (NEO) Toolkit you can visualise any asteroid’s orbit, including those making a close approach of Earth; get impressive illustrations of different groups and families of asteroids as well as plan upcoming observations and chart asteroids paths across the sky from any location in the world.Freely available via neo.ssa.esa.int/neo-toolkit, the tools are for professional and amateur astronomers alike, along with journalists, media and schools looking for accurate visuals and anyone with an interest in asteroids.The NEO Toolkit includes the Observation Planning Tool, Sky Chart Display Tool, Orbit Visualisation Tool and the Flyby Visualisation Tool.Using the infamous Apophis asteroid as a case study, find out below how to get started. Orbit Visualisation Tool The Orbit Visualisation Tool allows you to visualise individual asteroid orbits or see groups of asteroids in orbit based on their asteroid group, family, spectral class or observation priority. To get started, click on the arrow next to “Select objects” at the upper left of the screen to make your selection.NEO GroupsAll near-Earth objects fall into one of four groups: Atira, Aten, Apollo or Amor. This depends on their orbital period – the time it takes for one full rotation around the Sun – and whether their orbit crosses Earth’s own.Apophis, our case study, is for example an Aten asteroid as it has an orbital period shorter than Earth’s but still crosses Earth’s own path around the Sun. After its close flyby of Earth in 2029 however, Apophis’s orbit will be shifted enough by our planet’s gravity that it will fall into a different category: becoming an Apollo asteroid. Known Aten asteroids in orbit around the Sun (size not to scale), using ESA’s Orbit Visualisation Tool Asteroid familiesAsteroids are grouped into a family if they share orbital characteristics, such as the shape of their orbit (eccentricity) or how ‘high’ they rise from the orbital plane (orbital inclination). However, families of asteroids are also thought to have originated from the same original object. As fragments from past asteroid collisions, they are the leftovers of a much larger asteroid, a failed planet.Spectral classAn asteroid is classified with a specific spectral class depending on the sunlight it reflects; its particular emission spectrum, colour and sometimes its albedo (brightness). From this, astronomers get insights into the composition of an asteroid’s surface. Apophis, for example, is classified as an S-class asteroid, because of its stony composition.Observational priorityAsteroids on ESA’s Asteroid Risk List – the ever-changing list of asteroids that have a ‘non-zero’ chance of impact in the next hundred years – can also be selected. That’s right, more than 95% of known near-Earth asteroids have no chance of impact in a decade. The rest are being closely monitored, until experts have enough data to say for certain they will not strike. Flyby Visualisation Tool With the Flyby Visualisation Tool, any asteroid that will come within three lunar distances of Earth can be easily visualised as it makes its close approach. Flybys past, present and future can be conjured up, showing how an asteroid’s path bends and warps as it gets near our planet and past it.Search for any asteroid flyby over a given time period, or if you have a specific asteroid in mind simply click “Edit my list of objects” and add it to your list.Apophis will make a close Earth approach on 13 April 2029. By choosing a start date of 1 Jan 2029 and an end date of 31 Dec 2029, all flybys currently known within three lunar distances from Earth for that year appear, including (99942) Apophis. Alternatively, add the asteroid to your selected objects to filter just for Apophis flybys. Representation of Apophis’ close approach to Earth in 2029, with ESA’s Flyby Visualisation Tool Apophis’ path five days before and five days after closest approach can be played out using the media buttons under the image. The moment of close approach is coloured red at the centre of the time bar, and various options are available to alter the view, from altering the speed to zooming in or out on Earth or on the asteroid, inverting the colours and adding or removing various details on screen.Share your search results using the share button on the top left. Session data will be stored for 30 days. You can take a screenshot or movie of what you’re looking at using the “Export” button on the right. Observation Planning Tool The Observation Planning Tool can be used to check if and when an asteroid will be visible from any location on Earth, and when you’ll have the very best conditions for upcoming asteroid observations.The tool can be used for any date(s), but it provides precalculated physical data and ‘ephemerides’ (a table showing the trajectory of an object over time) for observations within 30 days from the present date. Further into the future than this the planning tool still works but will take a bit longer to finish the calculation of all ephemerides.This tool considers multiple variables over the timeframe selected that affect an asteroid’s visibility, including the relative position of the Sun, Moon and Galaxy, the sky’s movement, the density of the stars and the visibility and limitations of the telescope being used.Under the “Setup” tab, add the date range in which you are interested, the location of the “observatory” (you!) and add the asteroid or asteroids of interest. Click “Go to Filtering”.Under the Filtering tab you’ll find the list of asteroids selected and the visibility data in a graph format. Select your ‘time step’, i.e. the time interval between observations you’d like to check, and click “Calculate ephemerides”.To find out if and when Apophis will be visible over the month of January 2023, the following observation data was provided by the tool. ESA''s Observation Planning Tool shows five days in which Apophis will be visible from Darmstadt, Germany in January 2023 At the time this guide was prepared, asteroid Apophis was just over 200 million km from Earth. The Observation Planning Tool shows that Apophis will be visible for five days in the month of January 2023, seen from Darmstadt, Germany, under certain conditions shown in the bars on the left-hand side.Use the sliders to filter for the viewing conditions acceptable for the capabilities of your telescope.Moon elongation describes the Moon’s angular distance from the asteroid in question, as seen from the Earth (the vertex of the angle).Sun elongation similarly describes the angular distance between the Sun and the asteroid to be observed.Sky movement describes the speed of near-Earth objects in the sky with respect to the background stars.Magnitude describes the evolution of the apparent magnitude of the selected asteroid in the sky during the period selected.Galactic Latitude is measured in degrees north or south of the Galaxy''s fundamental plane of symmetry. This plane is defined by the galactic equator, the great circle in the sky best fitting the plane of the Milky Way, as determined by a combination of optical and radio measurements.The density of stars changes as asteroids move through the sky and their background constantly changes. This measure refers to the number of stars per square arcminute in the area surrounding the selected asteroid. Sky Chart Display Tool Finally, with the Sky Chart Display tool, you can see where near-Earth asteroids will appear in the night sky from any location on Earth. You can visualise a particular day or extend an asteroid’s path through time to see how it will move across the sky.Select the timeframe in which you will be observing and your location, and then add the asteroid(s) of interest. Either chose ‘Topocentric’ for a view from a point on Earth’s surface or ‘Geocentric’ for a view from Earth’s centre.Click on “Go to Visualisation” to create your asteroid sky chart. Note: For dates far in the future, it will take some time for the sky chart tool to load.This sky chart for Apophis was created for the month of January 2023, daily markers every two days and the observer located in Darmstadt, Germany.Use the ‘Display settings’ on the top-right to add or remove features such as coordinate grids and telescope parameters or to alter look of the asteroid trail. Add or remove constellations and deep sky objects by clicking on “Background objects” and decrease or increase the Field of View using the sliding bar on the bottom right.Click “Print” on the right to save what you see. Synodic Orbit Visualisation Tool Apophis in the new Synodic Orbit Visualisation Tool The Synodic Orbit Visualisation Tool offers a different perspective.To get started with the tool, select one or more objects on the left. You can set the visual magnitude of the telescope and then select a time period at the bottom of the screen. The object will then be shown in 3D with a choice between a Keplerian and a perturbed orbit. The perturbed orbit takes into account the gravitational effects of bodies in the Solar System. You can see the detection polar displayed with a toggle on the right, becoming visible as a yellow, balloon-like shape. If the chosen object’s trajectory at any point in time crosses into this region, it is observable with the chosen telescope’s limiting magnitude at that point in time. Another possible overlay is the solar elongation cone, which is the part of the field of vision that is blocked because it is too close to the Sun. Here, the Sun is so bright that it is impossible to observe the much dimmer reflections of the NEOs. Further toggles and settings allow you to adapt the visualisations further. The object orbit range will show the inner and outer boundaries of the range of the object from the Sun. Different bodies can be displayed either larger or proportional to their true size.There are also charts available that plot the asteroid’s distance to Earth, its phase angle and the resulting visual magnitude of the object throughout the chosen time period. The visualisations can also be exported as an image or a video file. More information about the Synodic Orbit Visualisation Tool can be found in this article and in the tutorial video.

For the second time this year, humankind predicted an asteroid impact. The ~1-m rock caused no harm and burnt up in the sky above Toronto as a striking fireball. The detection, warning and advance observations of this asteroid illustrate our rapidly increasing ability to warn of asteroid impacts, however small. In-depth Sixth sense Time-lapse photograph of 2022 WJ1 taken by astronomer Robert Weryk in Ontario, Canada The initial discovery of asteroid 2022 WJ1 came from the Catalina Sky Survey – one of the major projects dedicated to the discovery and follow-up of near-Earth objects (NEOs) – at 04:53 UTC (05:53 CET) on 19 November 2022, just under four hours before impact.The new asteroid was first imaged by Catalina''s 1.5-m Mt. Lemmon telescope, and once four observations were made it was reported to the Minor Planet Centre (MPC), 38 minutes after initial detection, at 05:31 UTC. These four observations were enough to map out the asteroid’s path in the sky, and within a few minutes of this ‘astrometry’ being published, ESA''s own internal monitoring software reported that the object had a ~20% chance of Earth impact, possibly hitting somewhere in North America in the next two to three hours. A few minutes later, other impact monitoring programs also sent alerts outlining a similar scenario. The first impact corridor computed by ESA’s Meerkat tool at 05:36 UTC, from early observations of asteroid 2022 WJ1 Following the potential impact notifications, observers at Catalina and elsewhere across the US got follow-up observations of the new asteroid. Less than 30 minutes from the initial trigger, the impact was confirmed with excellent precision: the small asteroid, likely less than a meter in diameter, was going to impact somewhere between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, near the US-Canada border, around 08:27 UTC (09:27 CET).At exactly the predicted time, a ~1-m asteroid struck the atmosphere becoming a brilliant fireball above the expected location. Find out more about this event at ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC) web portal. Asteroid impact: what’s the risk? Because of how the Solar System formed, small objects are in the majority in terms of their total population. It is estimated there are 40-50 million little asteroids and ‘just’ 1 000 of the biggest, giant ‘planet-killers’. The rest fall somewhere in between. Infographic: asteroid danger explained We currently know of more than 1.1 million asteroids, although many more are out there. Of those discovered, about 30 600 travel in an orbit that brings them near Earth’s own. These are the ‘near-Earth asteroids’ (NEAs).The reassuring news is that almost all the giant asteroids have been found – more than 95% – and none are of concern for the next hundred years. Astronomers are tirelessly searching for every last one. Chelyabinsk asteroid trail Small, metre-sized asteroids strike Earth every couple of weeks. They add to our understanding of asteroid populations, of fireballs and their makeup, but they aren’t a big priority when it comes to Planetary Defence because they pose no real danger.The objects we are most concerned about are those ‘goldilocks asteroids’ that are large enough to do harm if they impact, and there are enough of them out there that we know, at some point, they will. The infamous Chelyabinsk impact in February 2013 and the Tunguska impact in June 1908 fall into this category, and when it comes to discovering these asteroids, there’s still a lot of work to be done. Hera at Didymos That’s why ESA’s Planetary Defence Office is planning new telescopes on the ground and missions in space to improve our asteroid detection abilities, sending the Hera mission to the Dimorphos asteroid struck by NASA’s DART mission to test asteroid deflection, as well as working with the international community to prepare for the scenario in which a bigger asteroid is discovered on a collision course.

Space exploration has allowed us to look back on our planet in a way that no human could imagine before, revealing a fragile world with limited resources. As today’s statement explains, the responsibility to take care of our planet extends to and depends on, our actions in space. ESA is honoured to collaborate with space stakeholders in the signature of this Statement for a Responsible Space Sector, which makes clear:“Our objective is to provide a foundation for the sustainable, long-term economic development of the space sector and to increase the contribution of space activities to the sustainable development of society.” Why now? Space for Europe''s society and economy Taking advantage of the ESA Council at Ministerial level in Paris, ‘CM22’, against the backdrop of climate change on Earth and growing space debris in orbit, ESA and European actors from the space sector have expressed their commitment to meet the growing expectations of European States and citizens to address the global challenges faced by humankind. For decades space has been part of our critical infrastructure and increasingly more of the daily activities of nations and individuals depend on satellites in orbit. Our understanding of human health has been deepened by Space Station research, new economic markets have opened, jobs have been created and we continue to be inspired by the new perspective space science opens on the universe and our place in it. CryoSat “In recent years, the benefits of space exploration have become starkly clear like no time before,” says ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher.“Our Earth-observing satellites continue to reveal the worrying nature of our changing climate, through detailed images of natural disasters and extreme weather events that damage societies and take lives.”“Space activity is fundamental to taking care of our people and our planet, and in return, we must be responsible in how we behave in space. ESA is aiming at zero debris by 2030”.Today, European space actors commit to the long-term sustainability of space projects and pave the way for socially and environmentally responsible management of all activities within the space sector, for the purpose of fighting against climate change and preserving life and resources for future generations.As the statement describes, “There is only one planet that we may call home, and we must take care of it.” Europe’s vision for the space sector “…we intend to increase the contribution of projects led by the space sector to the sustainable development of society and work towards the socially and environmentally responsible management of all activities within the space sector, while fostering progress towards the principles and values set forth hereafter. Further, we intend to foster cooperation among European space actors, making best use of available resources and expertise, and avoiding duplication of efforts.” Five principles for space activity Statement for a responsible space sector Our actions are guided by our principles. In the Statement for a Responsible Space Sector, ESA and co-signatories set out five principles to underpin space activity which answer the question: who and what is space for?- For fair and responsible governance- For the benefit to all of society- For fair access to outer space, its preservation and peaceful exploration- For the preservation of our natural environment on Earth and remediation of damages caused to our planet- And for a fair society and improved wellbeing of all Underpinned by European values Europe, and ESA, is defined by cooperation between a multitude of countries, communities, cultures, languages and people. Our activity in space must reflect the values of those people and these partnerships. Today’s statement sets out the commitment of its signatories to the following values:- Integrity- Identity and Inclusiveness- Creativity and Curiosity- Excellence Real steps towards a responsible space sector To make this vision a reality, in accordance with the principles and values set out, ESA intends with its co-signatories to pursue and strengthen their coordinated efforts in these areas of common interest: preserving life, resources, humankind and society. ESA DG Josef Aschbacher on Zero Debris Access the video With this in mind, working groups on the topics of ‘Decarbonisation of the space sector’, ‘Responsible procurement’ and ‘LCA (Life-Cycle Assessment) and green technologies for space systems’ have been setup and are producing valuable outputs. Other key topics remain to be tackled, upon which the Statement offers a unique framework to act.

The majority of these were discovered in the last decade, showing how our ability to detect potentially risky asteroids is rapidly improving. In-depth What is a near-Earth asteroid? Access the video An asteroid is called a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) when its trajectory brings it within 1.3 Astronomical Units (au) of the Sun. 1 au is the distance between the Sun and Earth, and so NEAs can come within at least 0.3 au, 45 million km, of our planet’s orbit.Currently, near-Earth asteroids make up about a third of the roughly one million asteroids discovered so far in the Solar System. Most of them reside in the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars.Asteroids have been catalogued by astronomers for more than two centuries since the very first asteroid, Ceres, was discovered in 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi. The first near-Earth asteroid, (433) Eros, was discovered nearly one hundred years later, on 13 August 1898. Asteroid Eros, as seen by NEAR Shoemaker The roughly 30 km Eros asteroid was discovered by Carl Gustav Witt and Felix Linke at the Urania Observatory in Berlin and independently by Auguste Charlois at the Nice Observatory. The stony asteroid’s orbit brings it to within around 22 million km of Earth – 57 times the distance of the Moon.Not only is Eros the first known NEA, but the first asteroid to be orbited by a spacecraft and the first to have a spacecraft land on it. Early calculations of the space rock’s orbit also enabled a precise determination of the then imperfectly known distance between the Sun and Earth. How to un-Earth a near-Earth asteroid Naturally, large asteroids were discovered first as they are so much easier to see. They were thought of as minor planets, a term still used today. As telescopes get more sensitive, we are finding many more and at a great rate, even those down to tens of metres in size. Dramatic moonset behind ESO''s Very Large Telescope (VLT), Chile Ground-based survey telescopes such as the Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona, in the United States, discover new asteroids every week. They are designed to scan large sections of the sky, looking for new objects moving in front of the backdrop of ‘motionless’ stars.More focussed, large telescopes, such as the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT), can then be used for follow-up observations, helping us better understand a ‘new’ asteroid’s path, size and even composition.Gaia, ESA’s space observatory on a mission to catalogue one billion stars in the galaxy, has also helped us better understand the asteroid risk. Gaia’s first asteroid survey Access the video “Because of Gaia, we know more about the stars in the galaxy which act as a backdrop to asteroid observations,” explains Tineke Roegiers, community support for the Gaia mission.“Asteroid’s positions are obtained against these background stars, so, the better one knows where the stars are, the more precisely the orbits of asteroids can be computed.”With the use of ‘Gaia’s stars’, even the orbits of already-known near-Earth asteroids have been improved, and some asteroids that were “lost” were found again. ESA’s asteroid risk list A new home for Planetary Defence in Europe “Of course, any asteroid discovered near Earth qualifies as a near-Earth asteroid, but many are found far from home,” explains Marco Micheli, Astronomer at ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.“New objects are observed over time, their movements are studied and with just a handful of data points from different nights their future positions can be predicted. Depending on the number and quality of observations, this can extend decades, even hundreds of years into the future.” New radar observations of Apophis rule out future impact ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC) in ESRIN, Italy, is home to the Agency’s asteroid experts and risk assessors. The team activates its network of telescopes around the globe to get observations of new asteroids discovered and determine their impact risk, while also chasing up ‘old’ asteroids that haven’t yet been deemed safe.Currently, 1 425 asteroids with a ‘non-zero’ chance of impact are under their watchful eye, organised in the NEOCC’s Asteroid Risk List which is constantly updated and freely available for anyone to see. You can even sign up to ESA’s monthly ‘Asteroid Newsletter’, and the asteroid news will come direct to you. Will any of these asteroids strike Earth? DART''s moment of impact Currently, none of the near-Earth asteroids discovered so far are a concern, for at least one hundred years. Some of the smaller objects will and do impact Earth – but the most common are also the smallest and have little effect, except for creating trails of shooting stars as they burn up in the night sky.When it comes to large and potentially devastating asteroids larger than 1 km across and above, the majority have been discovered and none show an impact risk for at least a century. For those that could impact later, we have plenty of time to study them and prepare a deflection mission. Flyeye spies with many little eyes – ESA’s cutting-edge Flyeye telescope will scan the sky for new asteroids. Using a compound, fly-inspired eye it will break up the sky into smaller chunks and analyse each one The current priority are the medium-sized asteroids a few hundred metres in diameter. Many are still out there, waiting to be discovered, and at smallish sizes they’re not quite as easy to find.“The good news is that more than half of today’s known near-Earth asteroids were discovered in the last six years, showing just how much our asteroid eyesight is improving,” explains Richard Moissl, ESA’s Head of Planetary Defence.“As this new 30 000 detection milestone shows, and as new telescopes and methods of detection are built, it’s only a matter of time until we’ve found them all.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Observations are continuing of the debris plume caused by the collision for as long as possible, as the asteroid system gradually recedes from Earth. Hubble captures DART impact As a next step ESA’s Hera mission will return to the double asteroid system to investigate the consequences of the impact, gathering close-up data to turn this experiment in a scalable, repeatable technique that might one day be used for real.“The next mission to fly to the Didymos system is going to be the Hera mission, planned by ESA, a multinational endeavour to go back to the system and get a chance to look at it again a little later on,” commented Lori Glaze, Director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division. DART''s moment of impact Prior to DART’s impact, it took Dimorphos 11 hours and 55 minutes to orbit its larger parent asteroid, Didymos. Since DART’s intentional collision with Dimorphos on 26 September, astronomers have been using telescopes on Earth to measure how much that time has changed.Now, the investigation team has confirmed the spacecraft’s impact altered Dimorphos’ orbit around Didymos by 32 minutes, shortening the 11 hour and 55-minute orbit to 11 hours and 23 minutes. This measurement has a margin of uncertainty of approximately plus or minus 2 minutes. Streams of material from Dimorphos forming a comet-like tail Before its encounter, NASA had defined a minimum successful orbit period change of Dimorphos as change of 73 seconds or more. This early data show DART surpassed this minimum benchmark by more than 25 times. The investigation team is still acquiring data with ground-based observatories around the world – as well as with radar facilities at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Goldstone planetary radar in California and the National Science Foundation’s Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia. They are updating the period measurement with frequent observations to improve its precision.Focus now is shifting toward measuring the efficiency of momentum transfer from DART’s roughly 6.1-km-per-second collision with its target. This includes further analysis of the ‘ejecta’ – the many tons of asteroidal rock displaced and launched into space by the impact. The recoil from this blast of debris substantially enhanced DART’s push against Dimorphos – a little like a jet of air streaming out of a balloon sends the balloon in the opposite direction.To successfully understand the effect of the recoil from the ejecta, more information on of the asteroid’s physical properties, such as the characteristics of its surface, and how strong or weak it is, is needed. These issues are still being investigated. Hera''s propulsion module taking shape For this analysis, astronomers will continue to study imagery of Dimorphos from DART’s terminal approach and from the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging of Asteroids (LICIACube), provided by the Italian Space Agency, to approximate the asteroid’s mass and shape.Then, in exactly two years from now, ESA’s Hera spacecraft will embark on its own voyage to Didymos and Dimorphos to carry out detailed surveys of both bodies, with a particular focus on the crater left by DART’s collision and a precise measurement of Dimorphos’ mass, which is needed to determine the efficiency of the DART impact.Hera’s payload module is currently under construction at OHB in Germany, with its propulsion module taking shape at Avio in Italy. The spacecraft will also carry two shoebox-sized CubeSats for close-up observations. Hera scans DART’s impact crater Ian Carnelli, Hera project manager, commented: “Now that the DART mission has achieved its objective, it is up to the Hera mission to complete the experiment. The whole Hera team in ESA and industry is working around the clock to meet the launch date in October 2024. Seeing our spacecraft and payload in integration gives us confidence We are eager to provide our scientific community with the data necessary to unveil all the mysteries DART is exposing.” DART asteroid impact impresses in ESA’s view from the ground Access the video ESA contributions to DART effortOver the course of DART’s impact, ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre was watching. With access to telescopes around the globe, ESA’s astronomers had a direct view of the asteroid system as DART struck, capturing this remarkable footage of the birth of Dimorphos’ new plume.In the run-up to impact, ESA was also laser-focused on this world first mission. The Agency’s Estrack network of deep space antennas supported NASA’s own, filling in gaps in the Deep Space Network to ensure tracking and data download from DART was seamless, and the mission could lock on to its relatively tiny target at vast speed.

Moving at 6.1 km per second, the vending-machine-sized Double Asteroid Redirect Test spacecraft struck the 160-m diameter asteroid at 01:15 CEST (00:15 BST) in the early hours of Tuesday morning, in humankind’s first test of the ‘kinetic impactor’ method of planetary defence. Simulated version of the plume as DART impacts Dimorphos Ian Carnelli, Hera mission manager, says: “Making contact with a target that small across 11 million km of space is an impressive technical achievement in itself, tonight a wonderful page of space history has been written. One that we have all been looking forward to for many years. Today our thoughts are also with the late Prof. Andrea Milani who first outlined this deflection test in 2002.“Next comes a period of sustained observation by ground and space-based telescopes to determine if DART’s impact has indeed achieved what it was intended to do, and move the orbit of the Dimorphos ‘moonlet’ around its parent 780-m diameter Didymos asteroid. Hera scans DART’s impact crater “In parallel, ESA and our industrial partners continue our work to construct the Hera spacecraft, which will launch in late 2024, beginning its own voyage to Dimorphos to perform a close-up survey of the post-impact asteroid. Hera will gather key information such as the size of DART’s crater, the mass of Dimorphos and its make-up and internal structure. This extra data will help turn the DART deflection experiment into a well-understood, repeatable technique that might one day be carried out for real.” ESA''s Estrack network tracks DART in the vital moments before asteroid impact International collaborationNASA’s DART and ESA’s Hera missions are supported by the same international teams of scientists and astronomers, and take place through an international collaboration called AIDA – the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment. Planetary defence has no borders and is a great example of what international collaboration can achieve.The missions were conceived together during the early years of the 21st century, when concern about the destructive potential of incoming asteroids led to the creation of the first automated survey systems, resulting in ESA’s Near Earth Object Coordination Centre, NEOCC and NASA’s Sentry system.But the space scientists working on the system realised that asteroid threat identification was not sufficient; they also needed to come up with a way of addressing that threat. Dimorphos asteroid to scale with Rome''s Colosseum Ian explains: “Mathematican and astronomer Andrea Milani of the University of Pisa – a planetary defence pioneer who sadly passed away in 2018 – came up with the idea of a double-spacecraft mission he called ‘Don Quijote’: one spacecraft would impact an oncoming asteroid while the other observer spacecraft would measure the degree of deflection.”In the event the concept was internationalised, with NASA taking on what would evolve into DART. ESA’s Hera will follow its predecessor into space in 2024, arriving at Dimorphos two years later. Its target asteroid will hold special significance as the first body in the Solar System to have had both its surface and its orbit modified by human intervention in a measurable way. Its name taken from the Greek for ‘having two forms’. Hera''s propulsion module taking shape ESA’s Hera spacecraft taking shapeHera’s payload module is currently taking shape at OHB in Germany while its propulsion module is finalised at Avio in Italy, with companies and institutions across 17 European countries making their own contribution to the mission – such as GMV in Spain, developing the automated guidance, navigation and control system that will allow the spacecraft to safely navigate the double-asteroid system, akin in function to a self-driving car.The desk-sized Hera is packed with instruments, with its optical Asteroid Framing Camera supplemented by thermal and spectral imagers, as well as a laser altimeter for surface mapping. Hera is also three spacecraft in one, because it will additionally deliver a pair of shoebox-sized ‘CubeSats’ into Dimorphos’ vicinity. Hera with its CubeSats The Juventas CubeSat will perform the first ever radar probe of an asteroid, while also carrying a gravimeter and accelerometer to measure the body’s ultra-low gravity. The other CubeSat, Milani – named after AIDA’s inventor – will perform near-infrared spectral imaging and sample asteroid dust.The CubeSat pair will remain in contact with their Hera mothership and each other through a novel inter-satellite link system, to build up experience of overseeing multiple spacecraft in exotic near-weightlessness, before eventually touching down on Dimorphos. Ian concludes: “Thanks to DART, we’ve had a tantalising glimpse of our destination, now we can’t wait to go back and explore it in depth, to find out how the impact has changed it, and help make Earth a safer place in the process.” The incredible adventures of the Hera mission – Creating a crater Access the video Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

The moment the spacecraft collides with the asteroid a plume of material is expected to be thrown into space, which will tell us a great deal about the rock’s composition and how much energy has been transferred to it by the collision. ESA will contribute significantly to ground-based observations of the new plume, as telescopes contracted by the Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre get ready to witness history. In-depth Over the past few years, astronomers have been very busy observing a pair of gravitationally bound asteroids, together in orbit around the Sun, to get precise data on their orbits. Dimorphos is the smaller ‘moonlet’ of the binary system, which orbits the larger, central asteroid, Didymos. Didymos asteroids As DART impacts Dimorphos, it is expected to slightly alter the asteroid moon’s orbit around Didymos. To calculate how much the moon’s orbit is altered over time it''s ‘light curve’ will be measured by observing the sunlight reflected from it with telescopes on the ground, and using this to calculate the change in the orbital period of the double-asteroid system. Satellites in orbit, including the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes will also join the effort.Many of the ground-based telescopes participating in the light curve observing campaign won’t get a direct view of the moment of impact, because of Didymos’ position in relationship to Earth at the time. ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC) will have eyes on the sky as DART strikes and a plume of material is expected to be ejected from the stricken asteroid.Studying the first moments of this dusty plume will add to our understanding of the DART impact, revealing the amount of mass ejected and as a result, how much of a shove the colosseum-sized space rock has received. What do we expect to see? Asteroid collision Don’t expect a detailed scene-by-scene video of the ‘boom’. LICIACube – a CubeSat launched with DART to witness the crash – will observe the plume just a few minutes after the impact, as it performs its close fly-by 55 km from the asteroid''s surface. What we should see with telescopes on the ground is a dot in the sky that should, suddenly, increase in brightness.The images expected, of a speck nestled amongst the stars, are the bread and butter of astronomical research – they should reveal a great deal.“The more material ejected from the asteroid, the greater the amount of material available to reflect the sun''s light and so the more it will increase in brightness in the sky,” explains Dora Föhring, Astronomer at ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre.“It’s the first time something like this has ever been tested, making it hard to predict just how much material will be released by the impact. Current estimates suggest it will increase in brightness by around a magnitude, but in the most extreme scenarios this could be as much as four.” DART impacts asteroid moon, Dimorphos, seen from central asteroid Didymos The time-critical moment when the plume is created is expected to take place quite suddenly, which adds to the complexity of the observations – because astronomers don’t know how much the asteroid will increase in brightness, it’s difficult to calibrate their instruments.“Models predict this whole event will take place in two minutes, and it’s important we capture it as the properties of the very moment of impact will give us information about the kinetic impact as a whole,” explains Dora.“We want to approach such a time-critical event with a clear plan and make sure all our systems have been carefully tested, calibrated and are good to go. However, there may always be the need to adjust in the hours leading up to the impact, depending on the local weather conditions. It’ll be an exciting challenge!” What a humanmade ‘comet’ reveals Dimorphos’ plume will turn the asteroid moonlet into a kind-of humanmade comet. Its temporary tail will take weeks to months to disperse, letting us peer into its insides to understand its composition, and importantly for planetary defence, how dense or loosely packed it is. Dimorphos asteroid to scale with Rome''s Colosseum “A 160 m asteroid composed of loosely packed, ‘fluffy’ lumps of matter would have far less mass than a compacted, dense rock of the same size”, explains Marco Micheli, Astronomer at ESA’s NEOCC.“That first asteroid would do less damage if it were to impact Earth, with more of it breaking up and burning up in our atmosphere. The latter asteroid, 160 m of dense rock or metal, would release much, much more energy.”Aside from modelling Earth impacts and their consequences, we need to know the composition of any asteroid for if we ever need to impact it for real. Why? It''s all about conservation of momentum. The kinematic impact from DART only provides a small change in momentum. However, if it creates a large amount of mass being excavated and pushed with a large velocity in the opposite direction, this will give an additional boost of momentum to Dimorphos going the other way. The incredible adventures of the Hera mission – Creating a crater Access the video “The uncertainty in our predictions shows exactly why the DART mission is so needed, and why ESA’s follow-up Hera mission is such an exciting European contribution to this first test of planetary defence,” explains Ian Carnelli, Hera Mission Manager.“Hera and its two CubeSats will travel to Dimorphos to study the crater formed by DART, its internal structure and composition, and get the most precise measurements of the asteroid’s mass. All the while it will test autonomous and low-gravity operations in deep space, vital for reconnaissance missions to any risky asteroid discovered one day for real”. The Sun never rises on the NEOCC Region within the red lines shows observability of Dimorphos from ground at time of impact Because of the position of Dimorphos in the sky at the time of impact, only telescopes in the red region shown here will be able to see it. This includes two contracted by ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre: the 0.6 m Les Makes telescope on Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean and the 0.36 m Springbok telescope in Namibia.In South Africa, the 0.5 m SMARTnet telescope, usually used to track space debris, will also be available to ESA, along with the 0.4 m Watcher telescope led by an Irish team. In Qatar and at Drebach-South Observatory in Namibia, a team of advanced amateur astronomers is also lending time on their telescope to ESA and its network. ESA has access to a global network of asteroid observing telescopes Over the decades, ESA’s NEOCC has established a telescope network like no other. It is made up of the Agency’s own telescopes, those that are formally contracted and those available to ESA through ad hoc, informal agreements.As it’s always night-time somewhere, this means the NEOCC can get rapid access to telescopes ‘in the dark’, whenever an observation is needed of a potentially risky object.Follow @esaoperations on Twitter for live updates from ESA’s Planetary Defence Office and Estrack ground station network as we count down to the DART impact.

Impacting an asteroid, before an asteroid impacts us Hera and its CubeSats at Didymos system NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test, DART, is currently hurtling through space towards a pair of gravitationally bound asteroids in orbit around the Sun. The binary asteroid system is known as Didymos, and the smaller ‘moonlet’ of the pair, Dimorphos, will be the first asteroid in the Solar System to be the target of a humanmade ‘kinetic impactor’.In the aftermath of the impact, ESA’s Hera mission will fly to the stricken rock to carry out an in-depth analysis of the crater formed, the mass of the asteroid and a great deal more, turning this grand experiment into an understood and repeatable planetary defence technique.All this, however, depends on DART hitting its target. The spacecraft will be hurtling through space at about 6 000 m/s at a distance of 11 million kilometres from Earth, closing in on a moving object about the same size as the Great Pyramid of Giza – so this is no easy feat. ESA''s Malargüe tracking station In fact, it is only in the last hour before impact that DART will even be able to distinguish Dimorphos from the larger central asteroid, using its sophisticated onboard guidance, navigation and control system to autonomously manoeuvre it towards its unknowing target.ESA’s network of eyes on the sky, Estrack, is supporting NASA in the weeks before impact by tracking DART, helping to provide data on its status, location and velocity and crucially keeping a constant watch during its final 12 hours when a live stream of images will be pulsed home to be made available and watched ‘live’ by countless around the globe. Giant antennas come together Since May, ESA’s 35-metre deep space antenna in Malargüe, Argentina, has been helping to provide ultra-precise measurements of DART’s position with regular tracking time dedicated to the mission in the months leading up to impact. ESA''s Estrack network tracks DART in the vital moments before asteroid impact The station creates a geographical triangle on Earth when paired with the NASA antennas located in Canberra, Australia and the Goldstone in California. Tracking DART simultaneously from each location allows for an extremely precise determination of its location, orientation and speed. This method of tracking is known as Delta-DOR (delta-Differential One-way Range).ESA’s Deep space antenna in Australia has also been receiving monthly status reports from DART. Such reports are ‘downlinked’ to Earth from the spacecraft and include details on its status, location and any commands it was given – all crucial information for NASA’s mission control.Now in the final ten days before impact, tracking has ramped up even more as ESA’s Estrack network performs daily contacts with the spacecraft to fill the gaps in NASA Deep Space Network. Each of these ‘passes’, i.e. the period in which the spacecraft is visible and communicating with the antenna, lasts for about one hour every day until DART enters the final phase of its mission. BULLSEYE Asteroid collision In the last few hours of DART’s life, it will send to Earth a constant stream of images revealing its target resolve into view from blurry mass to small asteroid, dramatically getting closer and larger until … bullseye! This will be the first ever non-fiction movie depicting real-life asteroid deflection, and it’s critical that every scene arrives back home.“It is vital for mission success that there are no gaps in coverage during DART’s terminal phase, and so antennas around the world will be working in unison, backing each other up and filling in any gaps in NASA’s Deep Space Network coverage – we cannot lose the link to DART for a moment,” explains Daniel Firre, ESA’s DART Service Manager. ESA’s New Norcia deep space tracking station During this final period starting 12 hours before impact and lasting a couple of hours after, ESA’s New Norcia station in Australia will provide a continuously updated stream of data and images from the mission. Data from DART will have travelled 11 million kilometres before it arrives at the 35-metre dish in Australia, all in about half a minute.“Our giant dish in Australia will be in touch with DART as it crashes into Dimorphos. In the last minutes, data will stream in from the DRACO instrument onboard. This data will be used by scientists to estimate the mass of the asteroid, surface type and impact site,” explains Suzy Jackson, Maintenance & Operations Manager for the New Norcia ground station.“In addition, the data from DART will be used at NASA’s mission control to adjust mission parameters, and it’s really important the information arrives as close to real-time as possible.” Italian CubeSat to witness the crash Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA) collaboration The one thing DART can’t show us is the visual result of its impact with the asteroid. As it completes its job, the spacecraft will be destroyed, and communications to Earth will cease. Excitingly, a shoebox-sized CubeSat provided by the Italian Space Agency (ASI) will be riding with DART.The 14 kg LICIACube will separate from DART fifteen days before impact to capture images of the crash and the resulting cloud of ejected matter. Nearer to Hera Hera: ESA’s planetary defence mission Access the video To fully understand DART’s impact, once the dust has settled, ESA’s Hera mission will launch in 2024 and arrive at the Didymos asteroid system two years later to perform high-resolution visual, laser and radio science mapping of the asteroid moon and assess the consequences of the impact.As Hera launches, arrives at the Didymos pair and sends its data home, completing this remarkable first test of planetary defence, ESA’s Estrack network will as ever be getting this vital space data back home.Live coverage of DART’s impact with the asteroid Dimorphos will also air on NASA TV starting at 6 p.m. ET and the NASA website.

Dimorphos asteroid to scale with Rome''s Colosseum “At the same time, we are working at such a compressed schedule – with the launch planned for October 2024 – that we are already advancing in construction and integration. The flight model of the Hera spacecraft is fast taking shape at OHB in Bremen, Germany, and at Avio in Colleferro, Italy. Meanwhile functional testing of mission systems is ongoing on OHB''s Avionics Test Bench at Bremen.”The main purpose of the Critical Design Review is to confirm the design readiness of the Hera spacecraft, its instruments and interfaces with other mission segments, such as its launcher, ground infrastructure, and the two miniature ‘CubeSats’ that Hera will deploy upon arrival at the Didymos system. Milani studies asteroid dust Undertaken by an expert review board and involving hundreds of documents and data packages, the process covers all aspects of the mission’s readiness to safely perform its set goals in time and on schedule.The shoebox-sized Milani CubeSat – which will carry out spectral measurements of asteroid dust – and Juventas CubeSat – which will perform the first radar probe of an asteroid – have already passed their Critical Design Reviews, as has the TIRI thermal infrared instrument being supplied to Hera by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA. Juventas studies asteroid''s internal structure “Successful completion of the CDR brings us a step nearer to space,” adds Karim. “At the same time the Hera team will be watching closely as DART approaches Dimorphos. Its impact is a moment that we have been looking forward to for many years – our two missions were originally conceived together. And the initial glimpses of Dimorphos that DART sends back as it homes in on its target will be the very first time we get to see a place that all of us in the Hera team have been imagining for a very long time.” The Incredible Adventures of the Hera mission – Presenting Hera Access the video Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

In-depth Astronauts weather the storm While solar flares and small to medium-sized coronal mass ejections are unnervingly spectacular, these phenomena alone are unlikely to pose much risk to Artemis I or future crewed Moon missions. A solar eruption ‘Solar energetic particle events’ are the ones to watch out for. They occur when particles emitted by the Sun – mostly protons but also some ionised atoms like Helium – are sped up, accelerated to near relativistic velocities. It is these high-energy particles shot through space that can affect a spacecraft and its crew.Solar particle events are associated with particularly big solar flares and coronal mass ejections, as it is these eruptions that can cause shockwaves that shove solar particles to dangerous speeds.When it comes to the Artemis missions, much of the radiation from a particle event would be blocked by the walls of the space capsule – Orion and its European Service Module were designed to ensure the reliability of essential systems during radiation events.But the event could interfere with communications between the crew and teams on Earth, and the astronauts could have to seek refuge in a makeshift storm shelter, as happened on the Space Station in September 2017. Christer Fuglesang during his second spacewalk Yet, the Space Station was still well within the protection of Earth’s ‘magnetosphere’ – a protective bubble of magnetic field that the Moon doesn’t have.“Leaving the magnetosphere is like leaving a safe harbour and venturing out into the open ocean…” says Melanie Heil, Segment Coordinator of ESA’s Space Weather Office.“Radiation exposure for astronauts at the Moon can be an order of magnitude higher than on the Space Station and several orders of magnitude higher than on Earth’s surface. Future astronauts will face higher risks from solar particle events: it is very important that we study the radiation environment beyond the magnetosphere and improve our ability to predict and prepare for solar storms.” Near miss: the summer of ‘72 Apollo 17 Harrison Scmitt and rover Exactly 50 years ago in August 1972, a series of powerful solar storms including significant solar particle events caused widespread disruption to satellites and ground-based communications systems on Earth.The storms took place bang in the middle of NASA’s Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 Moon missions, with just a few months on either side. Fortunately, there were no human explorers outside the Earth’s protective magnetic field at the time. Had they encountered these storms from inside the command module, it is thought the radiation dose delivered would have caused acute radiation poisoning. For an astronaut on a spacewalk, it could be lethal.“Reliable space weather services are a necessity for exploration and long-term habitation of the Moon,” says Juha-Pekka Luntama, ESA’s Head of Space Weather.“A 1972-level event will happen again, and if we don’t stay vigilant, we may have astronauts in space and outside the protection of Earth’s magnetic field when it does.” Measuring radiation at the Moon Until now, we have mostly been concerned with the impacts of space weather on Earth’s infrastructure – power grids, communication systems, Earth-orbiting satellites and astronauts on the Space Station. The Moon as seen from the Space Station ESA’s Space Weather Service Network is spread across Europe, where experts process data from a wide range of radiation detectors onboard satellites in orbit and sensors on Earth.With this they provide information and services to a range of ‘users’ from satellite, airline and power grid operators to aurora hunters. The Network will continue to provide its services during the Artemis I flight and report any significant space weather event, predicted or oncoming.But for long-term human activity at the Moon, we need to monitor the lunar radiation environment directly. Helga, the radiation dummy Radiation research will be a major focus of the Artemis I test flight. The Orion capsule will carry radiation monitors from NASA and ESA, as well as a host of mannequins and CubeSats designed to help us better understand the radiation environment on the way to the Moon and its impact on human health.ESA is also working on the European Radiation Sensor Array (ERSA) project – a series of devices that will provide real-time radiation monitoring on board the future crewed lunar Gateway space station.Combining radiation measurements from the outside and inside of crewed spaces would allow researchers to see how much radiation ‘leaks’ in, and more accurately predict the risk to astronauts at the Moon when a space weather event is detected.ESA researchers are also looking into the possibility of including radiation instruments on other uncrewed Moon orbiters, such as Lunar Pathfinder and future lunar telecommunication satellite networks. Looking into the future Our star can be unpredictable and temperamental, but when ‘active regions’ appear on the solar surface, they tend to remain there from days to several weeks. If we could monitor these regions even before they rotate into view of Earth, we could improve our forecasts for space weather around Earth and the Moon. Introducing: ESA Vigil Access the video Early observation of active regions on the solar disk – from where flares and mass ejections erupt – is one of the main goals of ESA’s upcoming Vigil mission. Targeted to launch in 2029, Vigil will head to the 5th Lagrangian point (L5), a unique position in space that will allow it to see the ‘side’ of the Sun before it rotates into view from Earth.With Vigil, advance warnings for potentially hazardous space weather events are expected to be feasible several days before they’re in a position to endanger the health of astronauts in space or infrastructure on and around Earth. This would be particularly useful information for vulnerable lunar explorers and for planning high-risk activities such as EVAs.

While it ended its days burning up in Earth’s atmosphere on 31 July this year, the fragment began its life as part of Comet 169P/NEAT, responsible for the annual Alpha Capricornids meteor shower. In-depth Meteor showers occur as Earth passes through the debris-strewn path of a comet, which as it edges closer to the Sun and ices ‘sublimate’ from solid to gas, throws off a stream of material that lingers in place. As these objects collide with Earth’s atmosphere, they burn up as brilliant meteors, the brightest of which are known as fireballs.Such showers are periodic reminders that Earth is sweeping through an environment sprinkled with ancient remnants of the early Solar System. While safe, these impressive light shows offer a cautionary tale, as these many small fragments bely the larger objects they came from that once passed near Earth’s orbit – and could do again. Meteor''s trajectory determined through European fireball camera networks Access the video Using footage from on-the-ground cameras across Europe, including an ESA-operated camera of the AllSky7 network in Cebreros, Spain, and cameras in the Southwestern Europe Meteor Network (SWEMN), the fireball’s trajectory was calculated by SWEMN and its origins traced back in time. Entering the atmosphere at a height of 100 kilometres over Madrid and burning up at 77 kilometres above the Spanish province of Guadalajara, the icy body is thought to have been about 10 cm in size before contact with Earth.It is thought that the Alpha Capricornids meteor shower was created 3 500 to 5 000 years ago when half of Comet 169P/NEAT disintegrated and fell into dust. The comet itself will have formed at the same time as our Solar System, around 4.6 billion years ago. Space rocks infographic: things that go bump in the night The dusty trail from this ancient comet has drifted into Earth’s orbit creating infrequent but reasonably bright meteors. At its peak, only it creates only about five meteors per hour, but these are usually very bright and often become fireballs; particularly bright meteors.As this drift continues, the shower is expected to get stronger. By the year 2220, it should be stronger than any current annual meteor shower. For now however, you can catch it in its current form until about 15 August.

An ESA satellite dodges out of the way of a mystery piece of space junk spotted just hours before a potential collision.Now a crucial step in the spacecraft’s ongoing journey to safer skies has to be quickly rescheduled, as violent solar activity related to the ramping up of the solar cycle warps Earth’s atmosphere and threatens to drag it down out of orbit... In-depth A swarm? Of bugs?Not quite – Swarm is ESA’s mission to unravel the mysteries of Earth’s magnetic field. It’s made up of three satellites, A, B and C – affectionately known as Alpha, Bravo and Charlie. Swarm constellation What happened?A small piece of human-made rubbish circling our planet – known as space debris – was detected hurtling towards Alpha at 16:00 CEST, on 30 June. A potential collision was predicted just eight hours later, shortly after midnight. The risk of impact was high enough that Alpha needed to get out of the way – fast. There’s rubbish in space?A lot of it. Old satellites, rocket parts and small pieces of debris left over from previous collisions and messy breakups. Each little piece can cause serious damage to a satellite, larger ones can destroy a satellite and create large amount of new debris. Sentinel-1A fragment impact in space Was this the first time this has happened? That day? Maybe. Ever? No way. Each one of our satellites has to perform on average two evasive manoeuvres every year – and that’s not including all the alerts we get that don’t end up needing evasive action. Then what’s the big deal? Carrying out evasive action – known as a ‘collision avoidance manoeuvre’ – requires a lot of planning. You have to check that you’re not moving the satellite into a new orbit that puts it at risk of other collisions and you have to calculate how to get back to your original orbit using as little fuel and losing as little science data as possible.ESA’s Space Debris Office analyses data from the US Space Surveillance Network and raises the warning of a potential collision to ESA’s Flight Control and Flight Dynamics teams, usually more than 24 hours before the piece of debris comes closest to the satellite.In this case, we only got eight hours’ notice.And worse, the alert meant that the Swarm team was now suddenly racing against two clocks. Another manoeuvre was planned for just a few hours after the potential collision and had to be cancelled to give Alpha enough time to duck out of the way of the debris. That manoeuvre was also very time sensitive and had to be entirely replanned, recalculated and carried out within a day. What was the other manoeuvre? Alpha and Charlie were climbing to escape the wrath of the Sun. Both satellites needed to carry out 25 manoeuvres over a period of 10 weeks to reach their new higher orbits. One of Alpha’s manoeuvres was planned for just a few hours after the possible collision. Wait, the Sun is killing satellites? Our Sun is entering a very active part of its ‘solar cycle’ right now. This activity is increasing the density of Earth’s upper atmosphere. Satellites are running through ‘thicker’ air, slowing them down and requiring them to use up more limited onboard fuel to stay in orbit. Alpha and Charlie were moving up into a less dense part of the atmosphere where they can stay in orbit and collect science data hopefully for many more years and mission extensions! Solar cycle 25 prediction, NOAA, July 2022 What would have happened without this manoeuvre? Alpha would have drifted towards Charlie and the orbits of the two satellites would have soon crossed. This would have left the overall Swarm mission ‘cross-eyed’, limiting its ability to do science until another set of manoeuvres realigned Alpha and Charlie. Is Swarm OK now? The Swarm team got to work with a reaction time to rival an Olympic sprinter. Working together with the Flight Dynamics team at ESA’s mission control, they planned and carried out the evasive action in just four hours, and then replanned and carried out the other manoeuvre within 24 hours.Alpha is now safe from a collision with that piece of debris and has completed its climb to safer skies alongside Charlie. But there is lots of debris out there, and this shows with how little warning it can threaten a satellite. ESA''s laser ranging station in Tenerife aims its green laser to the sky How are your teams keeping up with all these collision alerts?With new tech, more sustainable behaviour and by taking our space debris responsibility very seriously. We’re building new technology to track more debris, developing new computational tools that will help us plan and carry out the rapidly increasing number of evasive manoeuvres, and working on guidelines that limit the amount of new rubbish we and other satellite operators add to the problem. We’re even working on ways to grab larger pieces of debris and remove them from orbit using a ‘space claw’. Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

They spill food all the time, but ESA’s XMM-Newton has caught a black hole in the act of ‘flipping over the table’ during an otherwise civilised meal.This act prevents the galaxy surrounding the black hole from forming new stars, giving us insight into how black holes and galaxies co-evolve. At the heart of every large galaxy lies a supermassive black hole, whose immense gravity draws in gas from its surroundings. As the gas spirals inwards, it bunches up in a flat ‘accretion disc’ around the black hole, where it heats and lights up. Over time, the gas closest to the black hole passes the point of no return and gets gobbled up.However, black holes only consume a fraction of the gas spiralling towards them. While encircling a black hole, some matter is flung back out into space, much like how a messy toddler spills a lot of what lies on their plate.In more dramatic episodes, a black hole will flip over the entire dinner table: gas in the accretion disc gets flung out in all directions at such high speeds that it clears out the surrounding interstellar gas. Not only does this deprive the black hole of food, it also means no new stars can form over a vast region, changing the structure of the galaxy.Until now, this ultra-fast ‘black hole wind’ had only been detected coming from extremely bright accretion discs, which are at the limit of how much matter they can draw in. This time, XMM-Newton detected ultra-fast wind in a distinctly average galaxy which you could say was ‘only snacking’. Hubble image of Markarian 817 “You might expect very fast winds if a fan was turned on to its highest setting. In the galaxy we studied, called Markarian 817, the fan was turned on at a lower power setting, but there were still incredibly energetic winds being generated,” notes undergraduate researcher Miranda Zak (University of Michigan), who played a central role in this research.“It is very uncommon to observe ultra-fast winds, and even less common to detect winds that have enough energy to alter the character of their host galaxy. The fact that Markarian 817 produced these winds for around a year, while not being in a particularly active state, suggests that black holes may reshape their host galaxies much more than previously thought,” adds co-author Elias Kammoun, astronomer at the Roma Tre University, Italy. X-rays blocked by the wind Active galactic centres send out high-energy light, including X-rays. Markarian 817 stood out to the researchers because it went awfully quiet. Observing the galaxy using NASA’s Swift observatory, Miranda recounts: “The X-ray signal was so faint that I was convinced I was doing something wrong!”Follow-up observations using ESA’s more sensitive X-ray telescope XMM-Newton revealed what was really happening: ultra-fast winds coming from the accretion disc were acting like a shroud, blocking out the X-rays sent out from the immediate surroundings of the black hole (called the corona). These measurements were backed up by observations made with NASA’s NuSTAR telescope. Artist''s impression of Markarian 817 A detailed analysis of the X-ray measurements showed that, far from sending out a single ‘puff’ of gas, the centre of Markarian 817 produced a gusty storm over a wide area in the accretion disc. The wind lasted for several hundreds of days and consisted of at least three distinct components, each moving at several percent of the speed of light.This solves an open puzzle in our understanding of how black holes and the galaxies around them influence one another. There are many galaxies – including the Milky Way – that appear to have large regions around their centres in which very few new stars form. This could be explained by black hole winds that clear out the star-forming gas, but this only works if the winds are fast enough, sustained for long enough, and are generated by black holes with typical levels of activity.“Many outstanding problems in the study of black holes are a matter of achieving detections through long observations that stretch over many hours to catch important events. This highlights the prime importance of the XMM-Newton mission for the future. No other mission can deliver the combination of its high sensitivity and its ability to make long, uninterrupted observations,” says Norbert Schartel, ESA’s XMM-Newton project scientist.

Now, ESA’s asteroid team working with experts at the European Southern Observatory have officially removed ‘2021 QM1’ from their asteroid risk list, a result of skilled observations and analysis of the faintest asteroid ever observed with one of the most sensitive telescopes in the world. With Asteroid Day Live 2022 set for 30 June, we can safely say that the riskiest asteroid known to humankind in the last year will not strike – at least not for the next century.*What was it like to track this asteroid? Get the full story in ESA’s fascinating behind-the-scenes look at how European experts handle asteroid risks in the official countdown to Asteroid Day live on 30 June, airing at 10:25 CEST on AsteroidDay.org and via ESA WebTV.* In-depth Impact 2052 2021 QM1 was initially discovered on 28 August 2021 by the Mount Lemmon observatory, located north of Tucson, Arizona. To start, nothing stood out as unusual about the discovery – about a dozen new near-Earth asteroids are discovered every dark night. Routine follow-up observations were then acquired from telescopes around the globe, but these started to tell a more worrying story.“These early observations gave us more information about the asteroid’s path, which we then projected into the future,” said Richard Moissl, ESA’s Head of Planetary Defence.“We could see its future paths around the Sun, and in 2052 it could come dangerously close to Earth. The more the asteroid was observed, the greater that risk became.” How asteroids go from threat to no sweat Access the video It’s important to note that orbit calculations based on just a few nights of observations come with some uncertainty, which is why asteroids often get onto ESA’s risk list soon after they are discovered and are then removed once more data is gathered, uncertainties shrink, and the asteroid is proven safe. On this occasion, that wasn’t possible. Unfortunate cosmic alignment Just as the risk appeared to be increasing, an (im)perfect cosmic alignment occurred: the asteroid’s path brought it closer to the Sun as seen from Earth, and for months it became impossible to see due to our star’s brilliant glare. 2021 QM1''s orbit as it passed closer to Sun in the sky as seen from Earth, soon after discovery “We just had to wait,” explained Marco Micheli, Astronomer at ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC).“But to cap things off, we knew that 2021 QM1 was also moving away from Earth in its current orbit – meaning by the time it passed out of the Sun’s glare, it could be too faint to detect.”While they waited, they prepared. Priority access to one of Earth’s most powerful telescopes Dramatic moonset behind ESO''s Very Large Telescope (VLT), Chile The European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) was primed and ready. As soon as the 50-meter asteroid edged out from the sunlight – and if and when weather conditions allowed – ESO’s VLT would focus its 8 m mirror on the disappearing rock.“We had a brief window in which to spot our risky asteroid,” explained Olivier Hainaut, Astronomer at ESO.“To make matters worse, it was passing through a region of the sky with the Milky Way just behind. Our small, faint, receding asteroid would have to be found against a backdrop of thousands of stars. These would turn out to be some of the trickiest asteroid observations we have ever made”. Faintest asteroid ever observed Over the night of 24 May, ESO’s VLT took a series of new images. The data arrived and Olivier and Marco began to process them, stacking subsequent observations on top of each other and removing the background stars: it took some time. ESO’s Very Large Telescope captures 2021 QM1 which for months topped risk lists around the glob. This pivotal sighting ruled out Earth impact in the year 2052. The result? A positive detection of the faintest asteroid ever observed. With a magnitude of 27 on the scale used by astronomers to describe the brightness of objects in the sky, 2021 QM1 was 250 million times fainter than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye from a dark spot. (In this astronomical scale of visible magnitudes, the brighter an object appears the lower the value of its magnitude, while the brightest objects reach negative values, e.g. the Sun is magnitude -27).Olivier was certain this small blur was in fact an asteroid, and Marco was certain that given its location, it was our asteroid. Safe at last? Asteroids on 13 June 2022 with Gaia With these new observations, our risky asteroid’s path was refined, ruling out an impact in 2052, and 2021 QM1 was removed from ESA’s risk list. Another 1377 remain.More than one million asteroids have been discovered in the Solar System, almost 30 000 of which pass near Earth, with many more expected to be out there. ESA’s Planetary Defence Office, NEOCC and astronomers around the globe are looking up to keep us safe, working together to ensure we know well in advance if an asteroid is discovered on a collision course.

The measures described in the guidelines set out how to design, fly, and dispose of space missions in ways that prevent the creation of further debris. They were major step for the protection of our important orbits and have served as the baseline for space policy, national legislation and technical standards for two decades.Since 2016, ESA’s Space Debris Office has published an annual Space Environment Report to provide a transparent overview of global space activities and determine how well these and other international debris-reduction measures are improving the long-term sustainability of spaceflight.Here are some of the key findings of the 2022 report. In-depth More satellites are being launched today than ever before. This is driven by the increasing number and scale of commercial satellite constellations in low-Earth orbit. Most, but not all, rocket bodies launched today are safely placed in compliant disposal orbits or removed from low-Earth orbit before they can fragment into clouds of dangerous debris. But active satellites today still have to dodge out of the way of objects that were launched decades ago and have since broken into fragments. Not enough satellites are removed from heavily congested low-Earth orbits at the end of their lives. Technological advances are improving our ability to spot and track smaller fragments of space debris. Our behaviour in space is improving but is still unsustainable in the long term. We''ve spotted more than 30 000 pieces of space debris The number of tracked pieces of space debris is now over 30 000 The amount of space debris in orbit continues to rise.More than 30 000 pieces of space debris have been recorded and are regularly tracked by space surveillance networks. As our technology improves, we are spotting an increasing number of unidentified objects (UI). Due to the time elapsed between their creation and our observation, it is difficult to trace their origins to a specific “fragmentation event”.Based on ESA models, the true number of objects larger than 1 cm in size is likely over one million. Smaller satellites; larger constellations Satellite constellations are growing in number and scale as technology becomes more reliable and compact The 2020s have marked the beginning of a new era in spaceflight.The technology required for large satellite constellations has quickly become more reliable and compact. As a result, the last two years has seen an enormous increase in the number of commercial satellites launched to near-Earth space, with the vast majority being smaller satellites weighing between 100 - 1000 kg.Many of these constellations are launched to provide communication services around the globe. They have great benefits, but will pose a challenge to long-term sustainability. More satellites are sharing a ride Travelling into space used to be a lonely affair - now many satellites ride-share into orbit. Constellations are also changing the way satellites get into space. 2021 saw a record number of rocket rockets carrying multiple satellites into orbit at the same time. This reduces the launch cost per satellite, but often makes it more difficult for surveillance networks to spot and keep track of individual objects. Low-Earth orbit is getting crowded Satellites in low-Earth orbit receive an increasing number of close encounter alerts every year The increase in launch traffic and the long-lasting nature of space debris in low-Earth orbit is causing a significant number of close encounters, known as "conjunctions", between active satellites and other objects in heavily congested orbits.This plot shows number of times a typical satellite at various altitudes experienced a possible collision alert during 2021.At lower altitudes, satellites more frequently encounter small satellites and constellations. At higher altitudes, they more often encounter debris objects left over from a small number of famous and significant fragmentation events – visible in this plot in shades of blue.Not all alerts require evasive action. But as the number of alerts increases, it will become impossible for spacecraft operators to respond to them all manually. ESA is developing automated systems that use artificial intelligence and other technologies to help operators carry out “collision avoidance manoeuvres” and reduce the number of false alarms. We are making progress in some areas Many rocket bodies launched today are disposed of responsibly One positive note for the debris environment is that many rocket bodies launched today to deliver satellites into low-Earth orbit are disposed of sustainably. Some are burned up using a “controlled reentry” into Earth’s atmosphere, while others are placed in orbits that naturally decay within 25 years.Rocket bodies are the largest objects we send to space and their removal from busy orbital highways reduces the chance they explode or fragment into many pieces of dangerous debris. More satellites need to be disposed of responsibly at the end of their mission An increasing number of satellites reaching the end of their mission in low-Earth orbit are being disposed of responsibly, but there is still work to be done. An increasing percentage of disposal attempts are successful, but too many are left drifting in important orbits with no attempt made to remove them.A successful removal rate of at least 90% for all types of space object is required to limit the growth rate of space debris, before we can start cleaning it up. But we need to do more Our current behaviour could leave some orbits inhospitable in future While we may be more responsible with what we launch today, our current efforts are not enough.If we don’t significantly change the way we use launch, fly and dispose of space objects, an “extrapolation” of our current behaviour into the future shows how the number of catastrophic in-space collisions could rise.Long term, this could lead to “Kessler Syndrome”, the situation in which the density of objects in orbit is high enough that collisions between objects and debris create a cascade effect, each crash generating debris that then increases the likelihood of further collisions. At this point, certain low-Earth orbits will become entirely inhospitable. It’s Time to Act Time to Act Access the video The most effective way to avoid this situation is for more space actors to follow the IADC’s space debris mitigation guidelines – doing more to prevent in­-orbit explosions, avoid in-orbit collisions, and dispose of spacecraft safely at the end of their mission.Another necessary step is to start actively cleaning up the space environment – first removing existing, larger debris objects from busy regions before they can break apart into debris that threatens spacecraft even decades later. In April 2022, the Copernicus Sentinel-1A Earth observation satellite had to perform an evasive manoeuvre to avoid a fragment of such a rocket launched 30 years ago.ClearSpace-1 will be the first mission to remove a piece of space debris from orbit. The spacecraft will rendezvous with, capture and safely bring down a 112 kg defunct rocket part, launched in 2013, for a safe atmospheric reentry.ESA is purchasing the mission as a service from the Swiss start-up ‘Clearspace SA’ to demonstrate the technologies needed for active debris removal and as a first step to establishing a new and sustainable commercial sector in space dedicated to removing high-risk objects from our valuable and limited orbital highways.

In-depth Living close to an active star, in a Solar System filled with ancient and fast-moving asteroids, on a planet that is becoming increasingly surrounded by discarded satellites and their debris, comes with a plethora of challenges. ESA’s Space Safety programme carries out the activities necessary to mitigate and prevent the effects of these hazards.Inaugurated on 12 April, the new Space Safety Centre is a dedicated facility for the teams monitoring and responding to space weather. Electromagnetic radiation and charged particles hurled into space by the Sun can disrupt or damage active satellites, human space explorers and infrastructure on Earth such as power grids. ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher and Director Rolf Densing inaugurate new Space Safety Centre “This new ESA facility demonstrates the ambition of Europe to have its critical missions in orbit and civil infrastructure on ground well protected against hazards from space,” says ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher. Inside ESA''s new Space Safety Centre “In close cooperation with its Member States, ESA is contributing to more autonomous and resilient space programmes, today and in the future.”By monitoring the health of data arriving on Earth from our satellite instruments and from other space weather services, teams at ESA help keep spacecraft and astronauts safe from our star’s unpredictable outbursts, while contributing to the protection of civil infrastructure, like power grids, on ground. Building autonomy for Europe ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher inaugurates Space Safety Centre The Space Safety Centre is a first for ESA and provides a dynamic environment where next-generation space-weather capabilities, tools and models will be developed, tested and evaluated in close cooperation with European institutes and industry.The Centre also supports the provision of space weather information and warnings to ESA-operated space missions. It will work in close coordination with the Agency’s Space Weather Services Network, providing timely and reliable space weather information to European spacecraft operators, agencies, institutions, researchers and commercial sectors affected by solar activity including transportation, navigation and power grid operators.Teams at the Centre will monitor data received from ESA’s space weather sensors, comprising, today, payloads onboard Proba-2 and hosted on missions flown by other agencies and, in future, additionally from the Vigil and Aurora missions and from new nanosatellite missions.In future, it will also be used to monitor the utilisation of data acquired by ESA’s three upcoming space safety missions. Giant solar eruption captured by the ESA/NASA Solar Orbiter spacecraft in February 2022 - luckily this one wasn''t heading for Earth “The stand-up of this Centre at our ESOC mission control centre demonstrates leadership and is a clear step as ESA works to boost European autonomy in space,” says Rolf Densing, ESA’s Director of Operations.“A major space weather event could cause in excess of €15 billion damage in Europe. We cannot prevent space weather, but costly ground infrastructure and satellites – and the critical services they provide – can be protected through forecasts, timely warnings and real-time information.” Upcoming ESA Space Safety Missions VigilESA Vigil will monitor our active and unpredictable Sun to help protect us from its violent outbursts.By keeping an eagle eye on the ''side'' of the Sun, the spacecraft will stream a constant feed of near real-time data on potentially hazardous solar activity, complementing observations from other missions and enabling more accurate forecasting of space weather impacts on Earth. Vigil, planned to launch in the 2028 timeframe, will give us advance warning of oncoming solar storms and therefore more time to protect spacecraft in orbit, vital infrastructure on the ground and space explorers now and in the future not shielded by Earth''s magnetic field.

The evidence? Roughly 200 known craters scar Earth’s surface, telling an impactful story of how our planet, and life on it, has been dramatically shaped by violent collisions with ancient space rocks. On occasion – five in human history, to be precise – we discover an asteroid before it strikes. In-depth Warning of certain impact Predicted impact point and time, computed by ESA''s imminent impactor alert system "Meerkat" At 19:24 UTC on 11 March 2022, astronomer Krisztián Sárneczky discovered a bright and fast-moving new object in the sky using the 60cm Schmidt telescope at the Piszkéstető observatory, Hungary. He collected four observations in quick succession, and just 14 minutes later reported his findings to the Minor Planet Center (MPC), initially designating the object ‘Sar2593’.The results were quickly published and used by automatic impact assessment systems around the world to estimate the possibility of an impact: at the time, it seemed unlikely, at less than 1%. A new home for Planetary Defence in Europe Krisztián continued to observe the object, making a further 10 observations soon after the discovery and again submitting them to the MPC. These, however, resulted in an entirely different scenario. Almost exactly an hour after it was detected at 20:25 UTC, ESA’s “Meerkat” monitoring system triggered an alert to the Agency’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC) based on the accumulated observations.The chance of impact was now 100%, and would happen in less than an hour, sometime between 21:21 and 21:25 UTC. The new object’s impact location was already predictable to the nearest thousand kilometres, expected just a few hundred kilometres north of Iceland. Rapid response to a speedy space rock In response to ESA’s Meerkat alert and others like it, professional and amateur observers across Europe and Asia quickly started to observe the imminent impactor. Finding it was extremely challenging since the object was already very close (about 1/7th the distance to the Moon) and moving rapidly in the sky. Infographic: asteroid danger explained Another observatory – Kysuce, Slovakia – soon reported its successful observations, together with many more detections from the original discoverer. With this new data added to the mix, the location of the asteroid impact could be pinpointed even more precisely: the asteroid was going to enter the upper layers of our atmosphere roughly 140 km south of the Jan Mayen island at 21:22:42 UTC – less than two hours after being discovered.From its observed brightness, the object appeared to be very small. At roughly a metre in diameter it posed no threat to Earth, as at this size it would entirely burn up in Earth’s atmosphere.Shortly after the expected time of impact the Minor Planet Center designated the asteroid the title “2022 EB5”, becoming just the fifth known impactor observed in space before hitting our planet, and the first discovered from Europe. Vatnajokull glacier, Iceland. The remote location near where asteroid 2022 EB5 struck, made direct observations difficult Unfortunately, no conclusive visual or video detections of the corresponding fireball have been located at present, likely due to the remoteness of the impact location.Nevertheless, there is independent evidence that the impact did in fact occur thanks to the international network of infrasound detectors. Signals from the impact were detected from Iceland and Greenland, suggesting an energy release equivalent to roughly a magnitude 4.0 earthquake. Why only the fifth? It is estimated that between 40 and 100 tonnes of space material strike Earth every day, most in the form of very small particles. Larger objects, similar in size to 2022 EB5 are expected to strike roughly ten times per year. So why have only five asteroids been detected before impact? Cosmic caller goes out with a bang The news here is rather positive. Large asteroids, kilometres in diameter, are easier to spot. Although they could do immense damage, they are thankfully relatively rare. We now know where the vast majority of these are and can say for certain that they are safe, atleast for the next hundred years. The international community continues to seek out every last one.Smaller asteroids are far more common and strike Earth much more frequently, but their impact is small and they’re much harder to spot. All five asteroids, spotted before impact, were found since 2008, illustrating how much asteroid observation technologies have improved in the last years. Many more to come More dedicated sky scanning telescopes are in the pipeline, including ESA’s first state-of-the-art Flyeye telescope soon to be constructed in Monte Mufara, Italy. The new, European telescope will split each image into 16 smaller subimages, expanding its overall field of view – similar to the technique exploited by a fly’s compound eye. Light pathways through the Flyeye telescope “The extremely wide field of the new telescopes will allow us to cover a large area of the sky in just one night," says Detlef Koschny, ESA’s (now former) acting Head of Planetary Defence."This will reduce the chance that we miss any interesting object."As our ability to predict asteroid impacts improves, so will our preparation. For medium-sized impacts that can create airbursts in the sky, this means the chance to warn people to stay away from windows that could break in the explosion. For larger objects, this means having the chance to prepare asteroid deflection missions to prevent impact altogether.

Despite the Moon’s attempt to scupper observations, the asteroid is now known to be entirely safe.*Join ESA, NASA and Asteroid Day LIVE from 19:00 CET this evening in "Killing asteroids - with the experts", to find out more*. In-depth Initial observations of an asteroid dubbed ‘2022 AE1’ showed a potential Earth impact on 4 July 2023 – not enough time to attempt deflection and large enough to do real damage to a local area should it strike.Worryingly, the chance of impact appeared to increase based on the first seven days of observations, followed by a dramatic week ‘in the dark’ as the full Moon outshone the potential impactor, ruling out further observations. As the Moon moved aside, the skies dimmed and ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC) took another look, only to find the chance of impact was dramatically falling.It has since been confirmed that 2022 AE1 will not impact Earth and has been removed from ESA’s risk list. So, what’s the story behind the excitement, and how can we trust this seemingly ‘meandering’ impact risk? Never seen anything like it “In January this year, we became aware of an asteroid with the highest ranking on the Palermo scale that we’ve seen in more than a decade, reaching -0.66” explains Marco Micheli, astronomer at ESA’s NEOCC.“In my almost ten years at ESA I’ve never seen such a risky object. It was a thrill to track 2022 AE1 and refine its trajectory until we had enough data to say for certain, this asteroid will not strike”. The Torino scale is a simplified version of the Palermo scale, used as a communication tool to illustrate the impact hazard of asteroids from a combination of their probability of impact and the energy they could strike with.] The Palermo scale is used by planetary defenders to categorise and prioritise the impact risk from near-Earth objects (NEOs) by combining the potential date of impact, the energy they would strike with and the impact probability.There are asteroids out there that will certainly hit Earth but are so small they are almost imperceptible as they burn up in our atmosphere. Others might be giant, extinction-level event asteroids which could do immense damage but are travelling in orbits around the Sun that are entirely safe.Values less than -2 on the Palermo Scale reflect events with no likely consequences; those between -2 and 0 indicate situations that merit careful monitoring, and positive values generally indicate situations that merit some level of concern. Planetary defenders – always alert Asteroid 2022 AE1 observed with the Calar Alto Schmidt telescope in Spain On 7 January, one day after its discovery by the Catalina Sky Survey, asteroid 2022 AE1 was flagged for a potential future impact by the Asteroid Orbit Determination (AstOD) automated system that makes up part of the NEOCC’s suite of tools to assess the asteroid risk.Every day, the system automatically calculates the orbits from asteroid observation data provided by telescopes and observatories around the world. It then computes the Palermo Scale values, immediately publishing the results on the NEOCC web portal.More risky cases – when asteroids are categorized as -2 or above on the Palermo Scale – are first cross-referenced with analysis from NASA JPL, to be extra certain of calculations before they’re published on the public page.“I was surprised at first when I heard about this asteroid as it is very rare to have such high Palermo scale, at first rated -1.5. Yet, I wasn’t too concerned as we get notifications like this – though at a lower level – few times per year,” explains Luca Conversi, Manager of the NEOCC.“As it is custom in these cases, we activated our global network of telescopes to immediately get more observations and it soon seemed this asteroid was unlike any other we’d seen.” The Sun never rises on ESA’s eyes on the sky … On the evening of Saturday 8 January, Marco ‘the impactor killer’ Micheli got hold of the 80 cm Schmidt telescope in Calar Alto, which the Coordination Centre has nearly continuous access to (weather permitting), to get more data.“There’s no waiting till Monday when you’re back in the Office with this job,” explains Marco, whose role is to gather enough data on asteroids in ESA’s ‘risk list’ such that they can be deemed safe, at which point they are removed. ESA NEOCC has near-real-time access to a global network of telescopes “But I love it, it’s part of the challenge. What makes this ‘detective work’ so much easier is that we have a network of telescopes on every continent that we can access in near real-time. It’s actually a unique capability of ESA which means it’s always night-time somewhere in our network, necessary to make asteroid observations”.ESA continued to monitor the asteroid, verifying results with NASA JPL which confirmed a worrying increase in the large rock’s chance of impact. Unfortunately, as the probability of impact peaked, observations became impossible. … until the Moon gets in the way Moon seen from Space Station During a tense week over 12-19 January, 2022 AE1 couldn’t be seen as the Moon outshone the dim potential impactor. On top of this, the asteroid was moving further away in its current orbit and getting fainter at the same time.“We just had to wait,” says Marco. Another one bites the dust Asteroid 2022 AE1 topped ESA''s risk list before being removed entirely As soon as the Moon was dim enough, the NEOCC team pointed the Schmidt telescope at where 2022 AE1 was expected to be. With one single observation, the risk level crashed – getting close to zero – and with that, the team moved on.“The data was clear, confirmed the next morning by our counterparts at NASA - asteroid 2022 AE1 poses no impact risk,” explains Laura Faggioli, near-Earth object dynamicist in the NEOCC who computed the orbit of 2022 AE1 throughout the observation period.“Had 2022 AE1’s path remained uncertain we would have used any means possible to keep watching it with the biggest telescopes we have. As it was removed from our risk list, we didn’t need to follow it anymore - time to move onto the next.”Although some keen observers have continued to monitor the asteroid, confirming results from ESA, we now know that in early July 2023, asteroid 2022 AE1 will fly by Earth at a distance of about ten million kilometres (+/- one million km) – more than 20 times the distance of the Moon. Asteroids often look risky before they’re proven safe How asteroids go from threat to no sweat Access the video It’s a funny thing about homing in on an asteroid and calculating its path, future position, and probability of impacting Earth – it will often appear risky during initial observations, get riskier, and then suddenly become entirely safe.In the case of an asteroid on a definite collision course, the risk would keep growing until it reaches 100%. Fortunately, in most cases, the risk of impact ultimately flattens before rapidly getting down to zero – but why? Does this suggest our results are uncertain? Can we really be sure asteroid 2022 AE1 is safe? 2022 AE1’s most risky risk corridor The very first observation of an asteroid is ‘just’ a single dot of light in the sky. At this point, it’s not clear what it is or where it’s going. A second observation is needed to reveal an object in motion, at least three are needed to determine an orbit – how quickly our asteroid is going and where it is headed. Further observations refine the orbit a little more, reducing uncertainties until we can be sure of where it won’t go: primarily to Earth.As is often the case, the overlap with Earth remains even while the risk corridor gets smaller due to further observations – and so the risk appears to increase.More often than not, as the hazard zone narrows, the small potential corridor moves off Earth and the risk suddenly drops. Even if some uncertainty remains about the path of an asteroid, we can know for sure it doesn’t pose a risk.ESA’s Planetary Defence Office and Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre are now focussing on the next space rocks that could pose a threat, working with the international community to ensure that when an asteroid’s risk doesn’t drop, and an Earth impact looks likely, we are ready.

As it reached ‘station acceptance’, it was handed over to ESA from the German company contracted to build it, DiGOS. The station is a technology testbed and a vital first step in making debris mitigation widely accessible to all space actors with a say in the future of our space environment. In-depth From satellite tracking to debris The IZN-1 laser ranging station in Tenerife is the first of its kind Imagine lasers pointing from Earth into the skies, seeking out satellites and bits of space trash and measuring their positions and trajectories to prevent catastrophic collisions. You don’t have to try too hard – this is very nearly the day-to-day reality at ESA’s new Izaña 1 (IZN-1) laser ranging station in Tenerife, Spain.IZN-1, developed and now operated by ESA, is a testbed for future technologies and was installed in mid-2021 at the Teide Observatory. ESA''s laser focus on space debris Access the video The station, telescope and laser have undergone months of testing and commissioning and since July last year have aimed the green beam of concentrated light to the sky to actively detect, track and observe active satellites.At present, the laser operates at 150mW but it will soon be upgraded so it can also track debris objects with a much more powerful infrared laser with an average power of 50 Watts.“Currently, only satellites fitted with retroreflectors can be tracked from ESA’s Izaña station, making up just a proportion of the total population,” explains Clemens Heese, Head of Optical Technologies.“The station will be upgraded in the next couple of years, enabling it to perform the same vital ranging services with uncooperative targets – vitally, debris objects and older satellites without retroreflecting patches.” The first of many in Europe While dozens of laser tracking stations are dotted around Europe, the Izaña station’s dual functionality makes it a first. Built by German company DiGOS, the remotely controlled Izaña station can also be used for optical communications and is intended to become a state-of-the-art, fully autonomous robotic system. It is hoped to be the first of many across the globe. Collision avoidance: what''s the cost? The technology, relatively new in the history of ground-based observations of space debris, will mean the station can track previously invisible defunct objects lurking above the blue daytime skies.As ESA’s newest addition to the Space Safety family, Izana-1 provides support for vital collision avoidance and provides a testbed for new sustainable technologies like laser momentum transfer or coordination of space traffic.Such satellite and debris tracking capability in Europe could contribute to building and accessing a European catalogue of space objects. Lasers in space. Is that … safe? ESA''s laser ranging station in Tenerife shines a light on debris problem But hold on, there are birds, planes, astronauts above us! Doesn’t aiming lasers into the sky come with an unacceptable risk? Fortunately, lasers used for satellite and debris tracking would be a disappointment to any self-respecting Bond villain.Ultimately, the IZN-1 station will use a power of under 100 Watts, giving the Izaña laser about 1/20th of the energy of an electric kettle.These pinpoint light sources shine short pulses of light at their target, determining the distance, velocity and orbit of each one with millimetre precision, calculated from the time it takes to complete the return journey.Although such lasers don’t come anywhere close to cutting through, or even nudging (yet) the objects they target, they can damage sensitive optical instruments on satellites and the paths of aircraft must be considered. IZN-1: ESA''s laser focus on the sky “If lasers strike planes they can be very dangerous, as pilots can become distracted and in worst-case scenarios, lose control,” explains Andrea di Mira, ESA Optoelectronics Engineer.“We are very, very careful that this does not happen, with a set of sensors scanning the sky for aircraft to ensure our lasers do not get remotely close to them”.These lasers also have the potential to disrupt telescopes studying the night’s sky. To prevent this, the Laser Traffic Control System (LTCS) was introduced by the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) – much like IZN-1 helps to prevent collisions between objects in orbit, the LTCS software prevents ‘collisions’ between laser light and areas of observation. Additionally, switching to an infrared laser frequency can minimize conflicts with astronomers. A vital step towards space traffic control As part of ESA’s ‘Protect Accelerator’, the Agency is prioritising the protection of space assets from the increasing problem of debris, as well as the effects of extreme solar events; space weather. As the era of New Space is now fully underway, large constellations are being launched to the skies consisting of thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of satellites.Current, costly methods of collision avoidance will be futile as numbers increase and as such the international space community will need to establish a method of space traffic control.For this, precise and rapid determination of the location, velocity and orbit of space objects will be vital, and ESA’s IZN-1 station will provide a much-needed testbed for this technology, far more accurate than current radar methods, to be developed. Laser focus on the future Operators at ESA''s IZN-1 laser ranging station In the near future, ESA’s IZN-1 station will be a fully autonomous, highly productive satellite and debris tracking station. It will also be used to test the concept of ‘networked space debris laser ranging’ to build a satellite catalogue.When it comes to optical communication, it will also be upgraded to receive signals with a very high data rate of 10 gigabits and beyond (adhering to international standards) from satellites in low-Earth orbit 400 km away.Izaña will then become part of a planned European Optical Nucleus Network, the first operational optical communication ground station service of its kind that will be made available to the wider commercial space community.On top of all this, the station provides an opportunity to test and develop technologies underpinning ‘laser momentum transfer’, in which lasers would not merely shine a light on debris objects but very gently nudge them into new orbits, out of the way of potential collisions and out of the busiest orbital highways.As IZN-1 is welcomed into to ESA’s Space Safety family, so is a bright future of sustainable technologies, vital for a responsible future in orbit and beyond. Protecting modern life Protection of space assets We are now reliant on interlinked technologies, in space and on Earth, for our everyday lives. But this infrastructure, and all that relies on it, is vulnerable.Solar storms can damage power grids, disrupt telecommunications and threaten satellites and the vital services they provide.

In-depth Once known as “Lagrange,” ESA’s upcoming space weather mission needed a new name that would reflect its vital role: helping to protect Earth’s infrastructure, satellites, inhabitants and space explorers from unpredictable but violent solar events like solar flares and ‘coronal mass ejections’.With 5422 submissions from across Europe and indeed around the world – and after weeks of deliberation, countless spreadsheets, three diverse and expert judges and a lively debate – a new name has been selected for our upcoming space weather mission: ESA Vigil. ESA Vigil Spacecraft monitoring the Sun Thousands of thoughtful, clever and funny names were submitted in the Agency’s #NameTheMission mission contest, which ran from May to September 2021.Once submissions closed, a team from ESA’s Communication department and Space Weather Office reviewed all submissions putting a shortlist of just nine names before a panel of invited, external judges.Armed with their top three respective choices, the judges then took part in a lively, two-hour video chat in which they made the case for their favourite and deliberated the merits of each. Finally, they agreed on a winner. Introducing: ESA Vigil Access the video “We are thrilled with our mission’s new name,” explains Juha-Pekka Luntama, ESA’s Head of Space Weather.“When I first heard it, I thought it was just spot on. That is exactly what we do, we keep a vigilant watch and guard Earth”.In Latin, ‘vigilis exceptus’ means sentry, or guard, while ‘vigilia’ means wakefulness and the act of keeping a devoted watch. The judges were particularly impressed with how the name resonated with the mission’s role – as a devoted guardian, keeping constant watch over the Sun, for Earth. The patch ESA Vigil mission patch Almost immediately, ESA’s design team began working on a patch that would evoke Vigil’s meaning. Throughout various iterations, the symbol of a soaring, watchful bird remained.Emmet Fletcher, Head of ESA’s Branding and Partnership Office explained the rationale behind the patch.“In this stunning design, the team has depicted a stylised wing of protection which shelters Earth from the Sun’s hazardous radiation. The wing emanates from Vigil’s orbital position and the critical geometry of this Lagrange point relative to the Earth and Sun is traced out. To balance out the mission patch, the L5 point is emphasised with the five stars shown just above the blue Earth.”And it’s the position of the wing, originating from the side of the Sun-Earth system, which really pleased the mission team.“We really like the patch design and how it still incorporates the vital importance of geometry to this mission,” explains Giuseppe Mandorlo, Mission Manager for ESA Vigil.“The Vigil mission will get a sneak peek of potentially hazardous solar activity only because of its location in space. Trailing ‘behind’ Earth at the fifth Lagrange point, ESA’s Vigil will see the side of the Sun, observing conditions before they rotate around to face our home.” The judges A key focus of the name campaign was to engage with a range of people from across Europe and give them the opportunity to express their perspective on our planet, space and the role of this important new mission.To cement the most appropriate mission name, ESA decided to invite a trio of external judges who would decide on behalf of Europe and its citizens. The judges, external to ESA but experts in their varied and diverse fields, chose the winning submission. Andrea Marcolongo Andrea Marcolongo is an Italian writer and journalist, author of many books including “The Ingenious Language: Nine Epic Reasons to Love Greek”. Andrea Marcolongo is an Italian writer and journalist. Currently living in Paris, she graduated in Classical Studies at the University of Milan and is the author of “The Ingenious Language: Nine Epic Reasons to Love Greek”; “The Heroic Measure”, about the myth of the Argonauts; “At the source of the words”, a compendium of ninety-nine etymologies and “Starting from Scratch. The life-changing lesson of Aeneas”.“It was not easy to choose among the different names, languages, myths, but ‘Vigil’ was my final choice,” explains Andrea Marcolongo, best-selling Italian author and one of three judges on the panel.“ESA Vigil is easy to remember but also smart, immediately illustrating the goals of the mission and it refers to a general idea of caring, looking after something. Moreover, as it comes from Latin, it is etymologically related with one of the most ancient languages at the core of Europe”. Rick Brink Rick Brink was chosen as the very first Minister of Disability Affairs for the Netherlands and now runs a consultancy that helps organisations with issues relating to diversity and inclusion.

Rick now runs a consultancy that helps organisations with issues relating to diversity and inclusion. Through these positions, he works to strengthen the position of people in the Netherlands who live with a disability.“A new name should always be pleasant in the mouth. ESA Vigil is one such name,” says Rick.“It is easy to remember and easy to link to what ESA will do in the mission. In addition, I find brevity and succinctness an important criteria. As far as I''m concerned, this mission name is more than successful.” Lucie Green Lucie Green is interested in how solar eruptions lead to stormy space weather affecting Earth and is passionate about engaging a wide range of audiences with science.

Lucie is Chair of Governors at the UCL Academy, Chief Stargazer at the Society for Popular Astronomy and author of “15 Million Degrees: journey to the centre of the Sun”.“It was fantastic to see so many people engage in this competition and that such a thoughtful set of names were proposed for ESA’s space weather mission,” Lucie explained.“Vigil really stood out though as capturing the essence of the mission’s aims, which are to keep a watchful eye on our active Sun and alert us to any dangerous emissions that are coming our way.” A word from our winner Francois Gosselin, whose winning entry Vigil becomes the name of ESA''s upcoming space weather mission “I am deeply honored that the European Space Agency selected my proposed name, Vigil, for their upcoming solar mission,” explains Francois Gosselin, winner of the #NameTheMission campaign with his submission, Vigil.“Living in Canada, I have been all too aware of the impact solar activity can have on Earth, such as the 1989 power outage in Quebec caused by a large solar flare.”Vigil, from the Latin "Vigilis Exceptus", meaning "sentry" was my inspiration for this ESA mission name. Sentry, watching the Sun for incoming events and alerting us perfectly reflects the mission objective.” Protecting modern life We are now reliant on interlinked technologies, in space and on Earth, for our everyday lives.

Debris enroute to the Moon 02/02/2022 14990 views 130 likes ESA / Space Safety / Space Debris Update as of 15 February: Additional analysis by, among others, citizen-scientist Bill Gray and colleagues at NASA''s JPL, now indicates that the object expected to impact the Moon is not the upper stage that delivered a previous US solar monitoring mission to the L1 Lagrange point.The impact location remains within a few kilometres of the predicted spot on 4 March 2022, within a few seconds of 12:25 UTC.This still-evolving finding underscores the need for enhanced space tracking, and greater data sharing between spacecraft operators, launch providers and the astronomy and space surveillance communities.Original articleThe Moon is set to gain one more crater. A leftover upper stage will impact the lunar surface in early March, marking the first time that a human-made debris item unintentionally reaches our natural satellite. The five Lagrange points A remnant of a previous flight beyond Earth orbit to an Sun-Earth Lagrange point – one of five such gravitationally-stable points between Earth and the Sun – the upper stage was unable to escape the Earth-Moon system. Instead it was left in a chaotic Sun-orbiting orbit near the two bodies. Now credible public estimates by citizen-scientist Bill Gray forecast its impact with the Moon on 4 March at 12:25:39 UTC at a point on the lunar far side near the equator. Follow-up observations should sharpen the accuracy of the forecast, but the upper stage is currently projected to hit at a speed of about 2.58 km/s.Scientifically vital points in spaceThe European Ariane 5 that recently delivered the James Webb Space Telescope to its assigned Lagrange point – but the good news is that its upper stage has already evaded a comparable fate thanks to a specifically developed and qualified manoeuvre. Europe’s Ariane 5 delivered the James Webb Space Telescope to L2, the second Sun-Earth Lagrange point, but after separating from Webb the upper stage used all its remaining fuel to escape the Earth-Moon system entirely, putting it into a stable heliocentric orbit.A brief history of human-made Moon impactsHuman-made objects have intentionally impacted the Moon before, starting as early as the 1950s, including Apollo upper stages used to induce ‘moonquakes’ for surface seismometers. NASA''s LCROSS impacting the Moon In 2009 NASA crashed its LCROSS mission into the Moon, revealing water in the resulting debris plume, with the LADEE spacecraft doing the same on the lunar farside in 2013. ESA’s Smart-1 spacecraft was crashed into the Moon in 2006, the subject of a worldwide observing campaign.“This forthcoming impact is a little beyond our usual area of interest, because we are mainly focused on the debris population in highly-trafficked low-Earth orbits, up to 2000 km altitude, as well as geosynchronous orbits around 35 000 km away,” explains Tim Flohrer of ESA’s Space Debris Office. ESA''s Smart-1 ended its mission in a lunar impact “Our colleagues in the ESA Planetary Defence Office peer further into space, however. They use telescopes around the globe to track Near-Earth asteroids, and sometimes observe human-made objects as well. Extending our own remit into the ‘cislunar’ space between Earth and the Moon has been discussed, due to the increasing use of the scientifically vital Sun-Earth Lagrange points in coming years.”Detlef Koschny, heading ESA’s Planetary Defence Office, adds: “We use telescopic observations to pinpoint the orbits, mainly of natural objects in the space surrounding Earth. Occasionally, we also pick up human-made objects far away from the Earth, such as lunar exploration spacecraft remnants, and objects returning from Lagrange points.” Webb’s journey to L2 For international spacefarers, no clear guidelines exist at the moment to regulate the disposal at end of life for spacecraft or spent upper stages sent to Lagrange points. Potentially crashing into the Moon or returning and burning up in Earth’s atmosphere have so far been the most straightforward default options.“The upcoming lunar impact illustrates well the need for a comprehensive regulatory regime in space, not only for the economically crucial orbits around Earth but also applying to the Moon,” says Holger Krag, Head of ESA’s Space Safety Programme. Artist''s view of Ariane 6 and Vega-C “It would take international consensus to establish effective regulations, but Europe can certainly lead the way.”All the launchers developed by ESA during the last decade – Vega, Ariane 6 and Vega C – incorporate a built-in reignition capability, which ensures the safe return to Earth for atmospheric burn-up of their upper stages. Lunar impact detection Assessing lunar impact riskSpace rocks hit the Moon all the time. Researchers are interested in quantifying the frequency of these natural lunar impacts. Using a system developed through an ESA contract, the Greek NELIOTA project (Near-Earth object Lunar Impacts and Optical TrAnsients) detects flashes of light caused by small bodies striking the Moon’s surface, particularly across its shadowed face. NELIOTA can determine the temperature of these impact flashes as well as their brightness. From this, the impacting mass can be estimated. The Kryoneri Observatory – the world''s largest eye on the Moon ESA’s Space Safety programme is interested in this research as a way of assessing the number of incoming objects ranging in size from tens of centimetres to metres across. This is useful because the precise number of objects in this range is not known very well.This research might also be valuable for future lunar colonists. One of the dangers they might face is small meteoroids doing damage to their infrastructure – NELIOTA results are helping to quantify the danger. Without an atmosphere to burn up such bodies, it is likely that future permanent lunar structures will be underground, to provide shielding against impacts as well as space radiation.

The physics that gives rise to the formation of these distinctive collections of ancient rocks is the same for all planets – including Earth.While the existence of Earth Trojans had been theorised for many years, the first direct observation of one was confirmed just over a decade ago. Since then, no second Earth Trojan had been discovered – until now. In-depth In this Q&A, Toni Santana-Ros (TSR) from the University of Alicante and Institute of Cosmos Sciences of the University of Barcelona, and Laura Faggioli (LF) from ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC) explain the importance and challenges behind the discovery of the second Earth Trojan asteroid.Santana-Ros is the lead author of the paper presenting the discovery of the second Earth Trojan, published today, 1 February, in Nature Communications. ESA’s NEOCC provided important support to the research. What are Trojan asteroids? TSR: TheTrojans are asteroids trapped in regions of space where the gravitational pull from the Sun and one of the planets is balanced. These regions are known as Lagrange points.The Trojans orbit around the Sun on roughly the same path as the planet and gather into groups near the two stable Lagrange points: one ahead of the planet (L4), and one behind it (L5). The Lagrange points associated with the Sun–Earth system How many Trojan asteroids are there? TSR: We’ve identified almost 10 000 Jupiter Trojans, and a few dozen at Venus, Mars, Uranus and Neptune combined. But it wasn’t until 2011 that the first, and until now, only, Earth Trojan was discovered: 2010 TK7.This second discovery, 2020 XL5, takes our total up to two, but there are almost certainly many more Earth Trojans out there just waiting to be discovered. Why are Earth Trojans important? TSR: Asteroids are time capsules from the earliest days of our Solar System and can teach us lots about the era of planetary formation.Earth Trojans are particularly interesting, as they could be leftover material from the formation of Earth. Even if they come from far away instead, their relatively stable orbits at Earth’s Lagrange points could still make them ideal destinations for a spacecraft mission. Why have we spotted so few Earth Trojans? LF: Geometry! The relative location in the sky of the Lagrange points and the Sun are fixed. That means the incredible brightness of our star is always coming from a similar direction as the Trojans and greatly limits our chance of spotting such small, dark objects. So, how did you find this one? TSR: Fortunately, there are small windows just before sunrise and after sunset where one of the Lagrange points peaks over the horizon while the Sun is hidden below it. These windows are short, don’t allow for long observations, and force astronomers to point their telescopes at angles close to the horizon where viewing conditions are at their worst.2020 XL5 was a known object, but it hadn’t been thoroughly studied. Our team used telescopes able to carry out observations of the asteroid under these difficult conditions and after studying the data, we confirmed that it is in fact the second known Earth Trojan! The Lutetia asteroid visited by the ESA Rosetta mission in 2010 Has it been there forever? Will it be there forever? TSR: 2020 XL5 is a “transient” Trojan asteroid; it won’t remain an Earth Trojan forever. We predict that in about 4000 years, it will leave Earth’s Lagrange point – possibly ending up on a highly elliptical orbit around the Sun like many other asteroids.This relatively short period of stability compared to the incredible age of the Solar System likely means that it did not begin its life here during Earth’s formation but was captured by our stable Lagrange point as it passed nearby many years later. How large is it? Could it pose a threat to Earth? LF: The new Earth Trojan, 2020 XL5, is roughly 1 km wide. That’s a significant size for an asteroid, but its home at the Lagrange point is roughly as far from Earth as the Sun, and its orbit will keep it that far away for thousands of years. What is ESA’s NEOCC? LF: The Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre is part of ESA’s Planetary Defence Office. We use our network of telescopes to spot and study near-Earth objects (NEOs) and provide a central access point to an entire network of other data sources on NEOs.We use this data every day to study the orbits of NEOs and assess any risk they pose to Earth. How did ESA assist this research? LF: My colleagues Marco Micheli and Luca Conversi carried out observations of 2020 XL5 using telescopes in the NEOCC network, including ESA''s Optical Ground Station telescope in Tenerife.They used their observations to determine the position of the asteroid at different times, which my colleague Ramona Cennamo and I then used to analyse its orbit. Our results demonstrated that it is a transient Earth Trojan. The Teide Observatory – ESA’s wandering eye What’s next? TSR: This discovery strongly encourages us to keep searching for new Earth Trojans. Finding an Earth Trojan made of material leftover from Earth’s formation would be incredibly helpful for unravelling many secrets of the early Solar System.We currently carry out regular observations of the sky in collaboration with the NEOCC. In particular, we are looking for objects that could represent a hazard for Earth, but these routine observations sometimes reveal big surprises.In the last few years, for example, we have begun to learn about a new group of very interesting objects: asteroids that orbit the Sun inside Earth’s orbit, or inner-Earth objects (IEOs). These objects will be at the top of our list going forward as, despite their relative closeness to Earth, they are still uncharted territory.

ESA establishments and facilities Space infrastructure is becoming ever more critical for Europe’s economy and society – and adversaries are taking note. Ensuring ‘cyber-resilience’ of our space and ground systems is therefore part of ESA’s daily duties.Entering operations in 2024, ESA’s new Cyber-Security Operations Centre (C-SOC) will provide an Agency-wide cyber-monitoring and management capability ESA has signed a ‘phase 2’ contract with a consortium of 19 European companies led by Leonardo in Italy to design, implement, build, validate and operate the C-SOC, under the technical responsibility of the ESA Security Office.“The C-SOC will represent a unique capability in Europe, reinforcing ESA’s preventative-reactive security measures,” says Massimo Mercati, heading ESA’s Security Office. Cyber-security Tommaso Profeta, Managing Director of Leonardo''s Cyber Security Division, adds: “As an international company dedicated to the management of technologies for the security of strategic assets, we are proud to be able to put our skills at the service of ESA for the protection of space assets and systems in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.”The establishment of C-SOC is in line with ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher’s Agenda 2025 charting the Agency’s near-term future, which emphasises the importance of ensuring cyber-security of European space assets so that citizens can rely safely on the systems and services they enable.Operating on a distributed architecture basis, the new C-SOC will be able to provide resilient and redundant security coverage to the entire ESA infrastructure, monitoring and managing its vulnerabilities 24 hours a day and 365 days a year – also improving security for ESA Member States and partners. Secure connectivity C-SOC will have nodes and interconnections distributed across all main ESA sites, while to allow widespread coverage across European territory, mobile C-SOC stations – Cyber Portable Operational Platforms – will be deployed as needed, in principle extending protection to partners involved in ESA missions.C-SOC development is being supported through ESA’s optional General Support Technology Programme, which works with European industry to convert promising engineering concepts into a broad spectrum of useable products.The centre is being established in parallel with other cybersecurity measures, including the Security Centre of Excellence, the sites working together to complement the capabilities of ESA’s state-of-the-art Computer and Communications Emergency Response Team.

However, it might become visible to the naked eye around its close approach on 12 December – a treat for those who spot it, but it gets a “yawn” (thankfully) from ESA’s Planetary Defence Office. In-depth Get out of the city if you’re in one, look up, and you’re likely to see sporadic ‘shooting stars’ ripping with speed through the atmosphere. Less common, but not entirely unusual, are distant, seemingly slow-moving comets, sometimes visible to the naked eye. Real colour composite image of comet Leonard This real colour image shows comet Leonard streaming through the sky on the morning of 7 December 2021, taken by ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC), part of the Agency’s Planetary Defence Office, using the Calar Alto Schmidt telescope in Spain.By superimposing a ‘stack’ of 90 images each five seconds ‘long’, the comet is revealed whizzing past background stars which appear here as colourful streaks going from green to red to blue – colours chosen to signify the three different filters used to observe Leonard.Centred around the comet’s bright nucleus, these colours come together to create a brilliant white glow of the nucleus, while the green-bluish hue around it is true-to-life, the typical colour emitted by comets due to their chemical composition. Near-Earth comet? Not even close Comet Leonard was travelling about 47 kilometres per second in its orbit around the Sun when imaged here on 7 December. On 12 December at 13:52 UTC, it will make its closest approach to Earth during this rotation, still an enormous 35 million kilometres away. Comet Leonard''s orbital trajectory sees it get close to the Sun before whizzing out again to the outer Solar System Currently, we know of 3775 comets in the Solar System. These small bodies are thought to be icy leftovers from the early phases of the forming of the outer planets. Orbiting the Sun, they edge towards the inner Solar System, emitting particles and gasses when heated by solar radiation producing their characteristic tail, then returning to the further reaches of about 50 000 times the distance of Earth from the Sun.Interestingly, these long tails linger in place even once the comet has moved on. It is when Earth sporadically passes through the old trail of ancient comets that meteor showers occur, a beautiful, safe reminder of Earth’s fragility in the Solar System. Meteor shower Sometimes, a comet’s orbit will see it edge close to Earth. Near-Earth Comets (NECs) are defined as those completing a full revolution of the Sun within 200 years, with a closest distance to the Sun within 1.3 Astronomical Units – the distance between the Sun and Earth.Such comets are kept under the close watchful eye of ESA’s NEOCC, because, like asteroids, any strike with Earth could have a very damaging impact. Fortunately, such comets are rare – with only 100 known at present and just one or two added to the books each year. Unique? Not really. Pretty? Very. While not many people will have witnessed a comet appear in the sky, comet Leonard is not particularly unique. In fact, it’s rather typical:“This is a bright-ish comet that we see in the skies on average once per year. As it gets a little closer, it could become visible to the naked eye, making for some attractive pictures, but, for us concerned with objects that could pose a threat to Earth, this comet is thankfully rather unspectacular,” explains Marco Micheli, Astronomer in ESA’s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre. Perseid meteor shower For everyone else, it will be worth checking the skies for this icy passer-by in the days after its close approach on 12 December (at its closest it won’t be visible as it will be too close to the glaring Sun).In a cosmic coincidence, this same period will be perfect for spotting shooting stars as, peaking around 13-14 December, will be the Geminid meteor shower.

The initial analysis of Euclid’s data validates the de-icing approach devised by the team. A more in-depth analysis of the results is ongoing and an update will follow in the coming days.A few layers of water ice – the width of a strand of DNA – are starting to impact Euclid’s vision; a common issue for spacecraft in the freezing cold of space, but a potential problem for this highly sensitive mission that requires remarkable precision to investigate the nature of the dark Universe. After months of research, Euclid teams across Europe are now testing a newly designed procedure to de-ice the mission''s optics. If successful, the operations will validate the mission teams’ plan to keep Euclid’s optical system as ice-free as possible for the rest of its life in orbit. Euclid’s vision fogs as it steps ‘outside’ In recent months, while fine-tuning and calibrating Euclid’s instruments after launch and preparing for the start of the mission’s first survey, science operations experts noticed a small but progressive decrease in the amount of light measured from stars observed repeatedly with the visible instrument (VIS).Euclid is experiencing a common problem that spacecraft face once they get to space: water absorbed from the air during assembly on Earth is now gradually being released from certain components in the spacecraft, teased out by the vacuum of space.In the freezing cold of Euclid’s new environment, those released water molecules tend to stick to the first surface they land on – and when they land on this highly sensitive mission’s optics, they can cause trouble.“We compared the starlight coming in through the VIS instrument with the recorded brightness of the same stars at earlier times, seen by both Euclid and ESA’s Gaia mission,” explains Mischa Schirmer, calibration scientist for the Euclid consortium and one of the main designers of the new de-icing plan.“Some stars in the Universe vary in their luminosity, but the majority are stable for many millions of years. So, when our instruments detected a faint, gradual decline in photons coming in, we knew it wasn’t them – it was us.”It was always expected that water could gradually build up and contaminate Euclid’s vision, as it is very difficult to build and launch a spacecraft from Earth without some of the water in our planet’s atmosphere creeping into it.For this reason, there was an ‘outgassing campaign’ shortly after launch where the telescope was warmed up by onboard heaters and also partially exposed to the Sun, sublimating most of the water molecules present at launch on or very near Euclid’s surfaces. A considerable fraction, however, has survived, by being absorbed in the multi-layer insulation, and is now being slowly released in the vacuum of space.After a huge amount of research – including lab studies into how minuscule layers of ice on mirror surfaces scatter and reflect light – and months of calibrations in space, the team determined that several layers of water molecules are likely frozen onto mirrors in Euclid’s optics. Likely just a few to few tens of nanometres thick – equivalent to the width of a strand of DNA – it’s a remarkable testament to the mission’s sensitivity that it is detecting such tiny amounts of ice.While Euclid''s observations and science continue, teams have come up with a plan to understand where the ice is in the optical system and mitigate its impact now and in the future, if it continues to accumulate. Approximately 10 kg of MLI covers Euclid''s two science instruments, but this material can absorb 1% of its own weight in water. Brand-new plan to decontaminate Euclid from 1.5 million km away “A complex mission requires a united response from teams across Europe, and I''m incredibly thankful for the effort and skill that so many have poured into this,” says Ralf Kohley, Euclid Instrument Operations Scientist who coordinated the response.“It took work from teams at ESA''s ESTEC technical heart in the Netherlands, the ESAC science operations centre in Madrid and the Flight Control Team at ESOC mission control in Darmstadt – but we couldn''t have done it without the Euclid consortium and the critical inputs we got from spacecraft prime contractor Thales Alenia Space and its industrial partner Airbus Space.”The easiest option would be to use the decontamination procedure developed well before launch and heat the entire spacecraft. Teams at mission control would send the commands to turn on every onboard heater for several days, slowly increasing temperatures from about –140 °C to, in some parts of the spacecraft, a ‘balmy’ –3°C.Doing this would clean the optics but would also heat the entire mechanical structure of the spacecraft. As most materials heat, they expand and don’t necessarily return to precisely the same state after a week-long cool-down, meaning a potentially subtle difference in Euclid’s optical alignment. This won’t do for such a sensitive mission where effects can be noticed on the optics from a temperature change of just a fraction of a degree, requiring at least several weeks of fine recalibration.“Most other space missions don’t have such demanding requirements on ‘thermo-optical stability’ as Euclid,” explains Andreas Rudolph, Euclid Flight Director at ESA''s mission control.“To fulfil Euclid’s scientific goals of making a 3D map of the Universe by observing billions of galaxies out to 10 billion light-years, across more than a third of the sky, means we have to keep the mission incredibly stable – and that includes its temperature. Switching on the heaters in the payload module therefore needs to be done with extreme care.”To limit thermal changes, the team will begin by individually heating low-risk optical parts of the spacecraft, located in areas where water released is unlikely to contaminate other instruments or optics. They will start with two of Euclid’s mirrors that can be warmed up independently. If the loss in light persists and starts to have an impact on science, they will continue to warm up other groups of Euclid’s mirrors, checking each time what percentage of photons they get back.Small amounts of water will continue to be released within Euclid over the life of the mission, so a long-term solution is needed to regularly de-ice its optics without taking up too much precious mission time – Euclid has six years to complete its survey."VIS will be measuring weak gravitational lensing – how matter in the Universe has bunched together under the influence of gravity as the Universe expands – and to understand this, the more galaxies we observe, the better,” explains Reiko Nakajima, VIS instrument scientist."De-icing should restore and preserve Euclid''s ability to collect light from these ancient galaxies, but it’s the first time we''re doing this procedure. We have very good guesses about which surface the ice is sticking to, but we won''t be sure until we do it.”Mischa concludes, “Once we have isolated the affected area, the hope is that we can then simply warm up this isolated part of the spacecraft in the future as needed. What we are doing is very complex and fine-grained, so that we can save valuable time in the future – I’m extremely excited to find out just where this water ice is accumulating, and how well our plan will work.”Despite how common this contamination issue is for spacecraft operating in cold conditions, there is surprisingly little published research about precisely how ice forms on optical mirrors and its impact on observations. Not only could Euclid reveal the nature of dark matter, but it could also shed light on an issue that has long plagued our roving eyes in space, peering down at Earth and out across the Universe.

After re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere and slowing down from around 28.000 km/h to about 500 km/h, the drogue chutes deployed, followed by the four main chutes.After being picked up by the recovery vessel Megan, the hatch on the side of the Dragon capsule was opened and each crew member was helped exiting the Dragon. Andreas Mogensen was the first person out, with a big smile and thumbs up. The Huginn mission Two Scandinavians in space Andreas spent 199 days in space, 197 of them on the International Space Station, after launching on 26 August 2023 from Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, US. It was the second space flight of Andreas, after his first mission in 2015, called iriss.The mission name, Huginn, was chosen by Andreas after suggestions from two Danes. The name ties Norse mythology and knowledge together with space exploration: Huginn was the raven of Norse god Odin, that flew together with Muninn out into the world to gather knowledge. Huginn and Muninn then told Odin about what they had seen at the end of each day. Andreas conducted science and gathered knowledge throughout his mission and told us about his journey through his pictures and videos from the International Space Station.This ties together with ESA project astronaut Marcus Wandt who launched on his Muninn mission in January 2024 to the International Space Station, marking the first time two Scandinavians were in space together.

However, a persistent difference, called the Hubble Tension, is seen between the value of the constant measured with a wide range of independent distance indicators and its value predicted from the afterglow of the Big Bang. The NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has confirmed that the Hubble Space Telescope’s keen eye was right all along, erasing any lingering doubt about Hubble’s measurements. NGC 5468 – Cepheid host galaxy One of the scientific justifications for building the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope was to use its observing power to provide an exact value for the expansion rate of the Universe. Prior to Hubble’s launch in 1990, observations from ground-based telescopes yielded huge uncertainties. Depending on the values deduced for the expansion rate, the Universe could be anywhere between 10 and 20 billion years old. Over the past 34 years Hubble has shrunk this measurement to an accuracy of less than one percent, splitting the difference with an age value of 13.8 billion years. This has been accomplished by refining the so-called ‘cosmic distance ladder’ by measuring important milepost markers known as Cepheid variable stars.However, the Hubble value does not agree with other measurements that imply that the Universe was expanding faster after the Big Bang. These observations were made by the ESA Planck satellite’s mapping of the cosmic microwave background radiation – a blueprint for how the Universe would evolve structure after it cooled down from the Big Bang.The simple solution to the dilemma would be to say that maybe the Hubble observations are wrong, as a result of some inaccuracy creeping into its measurements of the deep-space yardsticks. Then along came the James Webb Space Telescope, enabling astronomers to crosscheck Hubble’s results. Webb’s infrared views of Cepheids agreed with Hubble’s optical-light data. Webb confirmed that the Hubble telescope’s keen eye was right all along, erasing any lingering doubt about Hubble’s measurements.The bottom line is that the so-called Hubble Tension between what happens in the nearby Universe compared to the early Universe’s expansion remains a nagging puzzle for cosmologists. There may be something woven into the fabric of space that we don’t yet understand.Does resolving this discrepancy require new physics? Or is it a result of measurement errors between the two different methods used to determine the rate of expansion of space? Comparison of Hubble and Webb views of a Cepheid variable star Hubble and Webb have now tag-teamed to produce definitive measurements, furthering the case that something else – not measurement errors – is influencing the expansion rate.“With measurement errors negated, what remains is the real and exciting possibility that we have misunderstood the Universe,” said Adam Riess, a physicist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Adam holds a Nobel Prize for co-discovering the fact that the Universe’s expansion is accelerating, owing to a mysterious phenomenon now called ‘dark energy’.As a crosscheck, an initial Webb observation in 2023 confirmed that Hubble’s measurements of the expanding Universe were accurate. However, hoping to relieve the Hubble Tension, some scientists speculated that unseen errors in the measurement may grow and become visible as we look deeper into the Universe. In particular, stellar crowding could affect brightness measurements of more distant stars in a systematic way.The SH0ES (Supernova H0 for the Equation of State of Dark Energy) team, led by Adam, obtained additional observations with Webb of objects that are critical cosmic milepost markers, known as Cepheid variable stars, which can now be correlated with the Hubble data.“We’ve now spanned the whole range of what Hubble observed, and we can rule out a measurement error as the cause of the Hubble Tension with very high confidence,” Adam said.The team’s first few Webb observations in 2023 were successful in showing Hubble was on the right track in firmly establishing the fidelity of the first rungs of the so-called cosmic distance ladder.Astronomers use various methods to measure relative distances in the Universe, depending upon the object being observed. Collectively these techniques are known as the cosmic distance ladder – each rung or measurement technique relies upon the previous step for calibration.But some astronomers suggested that, moving outward along the ‘second rung’, the cosmic distance ladder might get shaky if the Cepheid measurements become less accurate with distance. Such inaccuracies could occur because the light of a Cepheid could blend with that of an adjacent star – an effect that could become more pronounced with distance as stars crowd together on the sky and become harder to distinguish from one another.The observational challenge is that past Hubble images of these more distant Cepheid variables look more huddled and overlapping with neighbouring stars at ever greater distances between us and their host galaxies, requiring careful accounting for this effect. Intervening dust further complicates the certainty of the measurements in visible light. Webb slices through the dust and naturally isolates the Cepheids from neighbouring stars because its vision is sharper than Hubble’s at infrared wavelengths.“Combining Webb and Hubble gives us the best of both worlds. We find that the Hubble measurements remain reliable as we climb farther along the cosmic distance ladder,” said Adam.The new Webb observations include five host galaxies of eight Type Ia supernovae containing a total of 1000 Cepheids, and reach out to the farthest galaxy where Cepheids have been well measured – NGC 5468, at a distance of 130 million light-years. “This spans the full range where we made measurements with Hubble. So, we’ve gone to the end of the second rung of the cosmic distance ladder,” said co-author Gagandeep Anand of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which operates the Webb and Hubble Telescopes for NASA.Together, Hubble’s and Webb’s confirmation of the Hubble Tension sets up other observatories to possibly settle the mystery, including NASA’s upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and ESA’s recently launched Euclid mission.At present it’s as though the distance ladder observed by Hubble and Webb has firmly set an anchor point on one shoreline of a river, and the afterglow of the Big Bang observed by Planck from the beginning of the Universe is set firmly on the other side. How the Universe’s expansion was changing in the billions of years between these two endpoints has yet to be directly observed. “We need to find out if we are missing something on how to connect the beginning of the Universe and the present day,” said Adam.These findings were published in the 6 February 2024 issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

GN-z11 in the GOODS-North field Delivering on its promise to transform our understanding of the early Universe, the James Webb Space Telescope is probing galaxies near the dawn of time. One of these is the exceptionally luminous galaxy GN-z11, which existed when the Universe was just a tiny fraction of its current age. Initially detected with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, it is one of the youngest and most distant galaxies ever observed, and it is also one of the most enigmatic. Why is it so bright? Webb appears to have found the answer.A team studying GN-z11 with Webb found the first clear evidence that the galaxy is hosting a central, supermassive black hole that is rapidly accreting matter. Their finding makes this the most distant active supermassive black hole spotted to date.“We found extremely dense gas that is common in the vicinity of supermassive black holes accreting gas,” explained principal investigator Roberto Maiolino of the Cavendish Laboratory and the Kavli Institute of Cosmology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. “These were the first clear signatures that GN-z11 is hosting a black hole that is gobbling matter.” Spectrum of GN-z11 Using Webb, the team also found indications of ionised chemical elements typically observed near accreting supermassive black holes. Additionally, they discovered that the galaxy is expelling a very powerful wind. Such high-velocity winds are typically driven by processes associated with vigorously accreting supermassive black holes.“Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) has revealed an extended component, tracing the host galaxy, and a central, compact source whose colours are consistent with those of an accretion disc surrounding a black hole,” said investigator Hannah Übler, also of the Cavendish Laboratory and the Kavli Institute.Together, this evidence shows that GN-z11 hosts a two-million-solar-mass, supermassive black hole in a very active phase of consuming matter, which is why it’s so luminous.A second team, also led by Maiolino, used Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) to find a gaseous clump of helium in the halo surrounding GN-z11.“The fact that we don’t see anything else beyond helium suggests that this clump must be fairly pristine,” said Roberto. “This is something that was expected by theory and simulations in the vicinity of particularly massive galaxies from these epochs – that there should be pockets of pristine gas surviving in the halo, and these may collapse and form Population III star clusters.” GN-z11 in the GOODS-North field (compass image) Finding the so far unseen Population III stars [1] – the first generation of stars formed almost entirely from hydrogen and helium – is one of the most important goals of modern astrophysics. These stars are expected to be very massive, very luminous, and very hot. Their signature would be the presence of ionised helium and the absence of chemical elements heavier than helium.The formation of the first stars and galaxies marks a fundamental shift in cosmic history, during which the Universe evolved from a dark and relatively simple state into the highly structured and complex environment we see today.In future Webb observations, Roberto, Hannah, and their team will explore GN-z11 in greater depth, and they hope to strengthen the case for the Population III stars that may be forming in its halo.The research on the pristine gas clump in GN-z11’s halo has been accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. The results of the study of GN-z11’s black hole were published in the journal Nature on 17 January 2024. Notes [1] The name Population III arose because astronomers had already classified the stars of the Milky Way as Population I (stars like the Sun, which are rich in heavier elements) and Population II (older stars with a low heavy-element content, found in the Milky Way bulge and halo, and in globular star clusters).

Such objects are difficult to get close to because we can only detect them when they fly near the Sun, leaving little time to plan and launch a mission. That’s why Comet Interceptor will be parked in space, springing to life to intercept a comet when the time is right. Comet Interceptor will address two core themes of ESA’s Cosmic Vision programme: How does the Solar System work? and What are the conditions for planet formation and the emergence of life?So – what mysteries will Comet Interceptor solve? 1. What does a pristine comet or interstellar object look like up close? Structure of a comet Observing an object from a distance means we can only get rough information about its shape and structure. This is even worse for comets, because their surface is shrouded by a cloud of gases called a coma. The gases come from ices that vaporise when the comet gets closer to the Sun. The same process creates the spectacular tails that give comets their distinctive appearance.Comet Interceptor is the first mission to take a close look at a pristine comet that has never or rarely entered the inner Solar System before. This could be a so-called long-period comet which comes from the outer reaches of the Sun’s realm, or maybe even an interstellar object that comes from outside the Solar System.The mission will make a three-dimensional map of the comet’s solid nucleus and gassy surroundings. It will do so by splitting into three parts that take simultaneous measurements from all sides and from different distances as the comet passes by.The measurements that Comet Interceptor makes will teach us about the target comet’s craters and depressions, how dusty or rocky its outer surface is, what compounds it carries and more. 2. How are pristine comets different from the comets we know? Earlier comet science missions targeted short-period comets that orbit the Sun in less than 200 years. However, repeatedly flying past the Sun doesn’t leave a comet unscathed. The Sun’s radiation makes the comet heat up and become active, spewing out gases and dust, and erasing its original appearance and make-up.By studying a more pristine type of comet, Comet Interceptor will teach us how comets are affected by their flight history. Crucially, by comparing the new data to measurements of short-period comets, we can see what’s different. These differences are important, because we base a lot of our understanding of the Solar System on the short-period comets we’ve studied in the past. 3. What was the early Solar System like? Comets are thought to be the icy remnants left behind when the outer planets formed billions of years ago. As such, the structure and composition of comets tell us about what the Solar System was like when the planets were forming.Rosetta’s up-close study of Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko showed that comets grew slowly in the dusty early years of our Solar System, sometimes getting a bulgy shape when multiple baby comets slowly collided and merged. Comets remain light, porous and icy because unlike planets, their cores never compacted and heated up.After forming, the much larger surrounding planetesimals and planets flung the comets outwards in a gravitational ‘pinball game’. Most comets currently live hundreds of billions of kilometres away in the Oort Cloud. Reservoirs of comets and asteroids As such, comets are frozen time capsules, their makeup reflecting the early Solar System. Out in the Oort Cloud they have remained frozen and unchanged for billions of years. Occasionally, they are disturbed by the gravitational tug of a passing star, like shaking apples out of a tree, causing them to travel back towards the Sun. Only when they re-enter the inner Solar System do they heat up, get bombarded by particles in the solar wind, feel the magnetic field of the Sun, and potentially collide with planets, moons and asteroids.Crucially, studying comets entering the inner Solar System is the only way for us to directly probe the Oort Cloud and, through it, the early Solar System. The existence of this ‘comet parking garage’ has been suspected and supported by theoretical models for decades, but it is too faint and distant for us to observe directly. 4. What is the role of comets in the appearance of life on Earth? Comets are famous for their brilliant tails. These appear because comets are rich in volatiles: elements or compounds that change from a solid or liquid state into a vapour at relatively low temperatures. This includes water and other compounds containing the six most common elements of life on Earth: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and phosphorus. As such, comets crashing into Earth may have been important for the emergence of life.One key question is the source of Earth’s water. We have a lot of it: 71% of our blue planet is covered by water. For a long time, it was believed that Earth formed as a hot dry planet, and that most water came from comets and asteroids crashing into it.This role of comets was unexpectedly put into question when ESA’s Rosetta mission showed that the water on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko has a different ‘flavour’ to the water on Earth. That is, the ratio of deuterium — an unusual form (isotope) of hydrogen with an additional neutron — to normal hydrogen in the water on the comet is very different to that on Earth.Rosetta also detected organic material crucial for the development of life. This includes the amino acid glycine, which is commonly found in proteins, and phosphorus, a key component of DNA and cell membranes. Comets carry ingredients for life Comet Interceptor will determine which organic molecules and other ingredients relevant for life are present on its target object, including ratios of different element isotopes. For many compounds and isotope ratios, the mission will be the first to measure them in a long-period comet or interstellar object. This will assist in answering questions about how comets may have contributed to the surprisingly rapid emergence of life on Earth. 5. Should we be worried about a comet striking Earth? The 2022 film Don’t Look Up tells the story of scientists detecting a large, long-period comet racing towards Earth, and our subsequent tragically comical failure to save ourselves from impending doom. This begs the question – should we be worried about a comet or interstellar object crashing into Earth?Asteroids and comets pass by (and hit) Earth regularly, which is one of the reasons why ESA’s Planetary Defence Office set up the Near-Earth Objects Coordination Centre to compute asteroid and comet orbits and their probabilities of striking the Earth. Together with other space agencies, ESA is also investigating how we can deflect incoming objects. Hubble captures DART asteroid impact debris In September 2022, NASA’s DART mission impacted Dimorphos, the moon of asteroid Didymos, changing its orbit in the world’s first technology demonstration of asteroid deflection. In 2024, ESA’s Hera mission will launch to investigate the post-impact state of the twin asteroids.Luckily, the likelihood of a catastrophic comet impact in the foreseeable future is estimated to be vanishingly small. However, should a comet be on collision course with earth, the warning time would currently be too short in most cases. We usually can’t see them coming until some months in advance, and a deflection mission needs several years or even decades of lead time.The time between detection of a hazardous object and its investigation or deflection by spacecraft can be reduced through ‘rapid response mission’. This is a mission that is built and launched beforehand and waiting in space until a relevant target appears. While not a planetary defence mission, Comet Interceptor is the first rapid response mission ever, validating this new way of doing a space mission.

Beyond consumer gadgets, such as wireless headsets and scratch-resistant lenses, space exploration is a catalyst for understanding the human body and advancing scientific results that benefit people worldwide. Here are Europe’s top 5 stories in space for your health.Gravity affects everything we do and everything that happens inside and around us. On Earth’s surface, everything is subject to an average gravitational acceleration of 9.81 m/s2, or what we call 1 g. This acceleration keeps us grounded but it also influences all reactions and phenomena around us, from falling apples to cell growth.Microgravity conditions allow scientists to study phenomena free from the influence of gravity and investigate in depth the fundamental mechanisms at play. The International Space Station provides uninterrupted periods of weightlessness and offers the opportunity for scientists to conduct research, with the help of astronauts on board, that would be impossible to perform on Earth. Growing old in space The effects on the human body in microgravity are similar to ageing but sped up: after six months in space, astronauts experience a loss in bone density of about 1% a month as well as muscle atrophy, losing up to a fifth of their muscle mass and two-fifths of their muscle strength. To fight this loss, astronauts exercise two hours every day on the Space Station. These detrimental effects are reversed once the astronauts spend some time back on Earth.A variety of experiments sent to the International Space Station, including the Molecular Muscle Experiment and Myotones, investigate the effects of microgravity on the musculoskeletal system. The In Vitro Bone experiment, sent to the Station in 2018, monitored the degradation of bone cells in the presence and absence of the irisin protein. The presence of irisin was found to counteract the effect of microgravity, which could lead to the development of an irisin-based therapy to the benefit of our ageing population. Growing old in space Access the video Monitoring close to your heart A technology developed to telemonitor the mechanical function of astronauts’ hearts while in microgravity will soon allow people on Earth to keep track of their heart’s health from the comfort of their homes. HeartKinetics, a business supported by the ESA innovation centre in Belgium, has developed a non-invasive way to keep track of your heart’s function using the accelerator and gyroscope sensors in your smartphone to record your heart’s mechanical activity and rhythm, delivering a remote cardiac assessment in just a few minutes. This technology will benefit the 49 million people living with cardiovascular disease in the EU who may not always be able to see a doctor, or who need follow-ups after being discharged from the hospital. The heart-monitoring technology has been tested in microgravity since the Space Shuttle era and in parabolic flights Growing blood vessels in space By cultivating human endothelial cells in space, which are the cells that line the inner wall of our blood vessels, researchers can gain insight into how these function and grow without the effect of gravity. During the Spheroids experiment conducted on the International Space Station in 2016, cell cultures cultivated in microgravity formed three-dimensional globular and tubular structures without the need for external support, a feat previously unattainable on Earth. The experiment results are opening up possibilities to grow artificial blood vessels as well as gain knowledge for the prevention and treatment of blood-related diseases such as hypertension and thrombosis. Growing blood vessels in space Access the video Tracking eyes from space to laser surgery An eye-tracking device developed for space is now commonly used in laser surgery. On Earth, your eyes can remain steady even while you shake your head, thanks to your inner ear which uses gravity as a reference. Researchers wanted to study how astronauts cope in space without this reference point and so needed a robust method to track their eyes without interfering with their work.After an eye-tracking helmet was tested on the International Space Station for several years, engineers realised the technology had an application on Earth in laser-eye surgery, where it is necessary to track the patient’s eye to precisely direct the laser scalpel. ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter wears the eye-tracking device in space Hibernation for space travel and surgery Human hibernation could be the best way to keep crew healthy on missions to Mars, but it also has potential medical applications, especially for surgery. By entering a state known as torpor, astronauts could significantly reduce their metabolic rates and energy consumption, meaning they would need to bring less food and water with them.Research by ESA’s science teams has also shown that hibernation could mitigate the harmful effects of cosmic radiation during prolonged space travel. On Earth, induced torpor has a variety of medical applications, especially for surgery: as a replacement for anaesthesia, for those who are allergic, or to improve survival rates in critical scenarios such as heart attacks or violence-related injuries.

Giotto provided the first good resolution images of a comet’s nucleus, while Rosetta was the first mission to monitor the changing activity of a cometary nucleus before and after flying by the Sun. For an overview of all previous and planned missions to comets, click here. Giotto: the first close encounter with a comet Comet Halley''s nucleus as seen by Giotto Launched on 2 July 1985, Giotto was ESA''s first deep space mission. It was part of an ambitious international fleet of five space probes — two Soviet, two Japanese and one European — which aimed to solve the mysteries surrounding Comet Halley. In the week before Giotto reached the comet, the Japanese spacecraft made long-distance measurements while the Soviet spacecraft got to within 9000 km of the comet’s nucleus. The information they sent back allowed Giotto to home in with great accuracy on Halley''s solid heart.On 13 March 1986, Giotto flew within 600 km of Comet Halley’s nucleus, taking images along the way. It showed that Halley is roughly potato-shaped, its dark surface spotted with active regions shooting bright jets of gas and dust into space.Years later, on 10 July 1992, Giotto became the first spacecraft to visit a second comet. It passed within just 200 km of Comet Grigg–Skjellerup. This provided a unique opportunity to compare the size, composition and velocity of dust particles coming from the two comets. Giotto also studied the interaction between the comet, the stream of particles in the solar wind and the magnetic field of the Sun and the planets. Rosetta: two years tailing a comet ESA’s Rosetta was launched on 2 March 2004. It reached Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 6 August 2014 and then flew alongside it for two whole years. Aside from taking images of the comet’s surface from different distances and from all angles, Rosetta showed for the first time how a comet is transformed by passing close to the Sun along its elliptical orbit. Rosetta''s ever-changing view of a comet Access the video The high-resolution images that Rosetta took showed that as the spacecraft passed by the Sun, boulders moved around on the surface, fractures appeared, cliffs collapsed, new regions of ice became exposed, dust was blown away and sometimes fell back down. Interestingly, the colour of the surface changed from redder to bluer and back again during the time that Rosetta tracked it.In another first, Rosetta carried a lander called Philae, which touched down (after bouncing) on the comet nucleus. The imprints that Philae left behind gave invaluable insight into how dense the surface is and what it is made of. It was found to be extremely soft — fluffier than froth on a cappuccino! Gases detected at Rosetta''s comet Rosetta also studied the ‘cometary zoo’ of gases coming off the comet. This includes many organic compounds that are important for life, as well as noble gases much like those in Earth’s atmosphere. On the other hand, the ‘flavour’ of water on the comet is different from that on Earth, leaving the role of comets in bringing water to Earth in doubt. Comet Interceptor: 3D-mapping a new type of comet One key question still unanswered after Rosetta is what properties were set in stone when the comet formed, and what features came later. Another puzzle is what exactly drives activity in comets. Comet Interceptor will address these questions by approaching a much more pristine type of comet and taking measurements from multiple locations at the same time.Importantly, this mission hopes to snare a long-period comet or interstellar object that has never (or rarely) passed close to the Sun before. This is the first time such an object will be seen up close. All comets visited so far, including by Giotto and Rosetta, were short-period comets that frequently pass through the inner Solar System.When reaching its target, Comet Interceptor will release two probes. The main spacecraft will pass around 1000 km from the comet’s surface, while the probes will get even closer, each taking a different route through the coma (the cloud of dust and gas surrounding the comet nucleus). In this way, it will map gas, dust and plasma in three dimensions. This was not possible with previous missions which sampled only a single location at a time.Comet Interceptor will only fly past its target comet once, so unlike Rosetta it will not be able to monitor changes in activity over long periods of time. However, by combining detailed simultaneous observations of the nucleus and the coma, the new data can reveal how the features and activity on the comet’s surface are linked to the structure of its coma.Click here to read more about the questions Comet Interceptor will help answer.

These findings help answer a longstanding question for astronomers: what sources caused the reionisation of the Universe? Pandora’s Cluster (Abell 2744) Much remains to be understood about the time in the Universe’s early history known as the era of reionisation [1]. It was a period of darkness without any stars or galaxies, filled with a dense fog of hydrogen gas, until the first stars ionised the gas around them and light began to travel through. Astronomers have spent decades trying to identify the sources that emitted radiation powerful enough to gradually clear away this hydrogen fog that blanketed the early Universe.The Ultradeep NIRSpec and NIRCam ObserVations before the Epoch of Reionization (UNCOVER) programme (#2561) consists of both imaging and spectroscopic observations of the lensing cluster Abell 2744. An international team of astronomers used gravitational lensing by this target, also known as Pandora’s Cluster, to investigate the sources of the Universe’s period of reionisation. Gravitational lensing [2] magnifies and distorts the appearance of distant galaxies, so they look very different from those in the foreground.The galaxy cluster ''lens'' is so massive that it warps the fabric of space itself, so much so that light from distant galaxies that passes through the warped space also takes on a warped appearance. The magnification effect allowed the team to study very distant sources of light beyond Abell 2744, revealing eight extremely faint galaxies that would otherwise be undetectable, even to Webb.The team found that these faint galaxies are immense producers of ultraviolet light, at levels that are four times larger than what was previously assumed. This means that most of the photons that reionised the Universe likely came from these dwarf galaxies.“This discovery unveils the crucial role played by ultra-faint galaxies in the early Universe''s evolution,” said team member Iryna Chemerynska of the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris in France. “They produce ionising photons that transform neutral hydrogen into ionised plasma during cosmic reionisation. It highlights the importance of understanding low-mass galaxies in shaping the Universe''s history.”“These cosmic powerhouses collectively emit more than enough energy to get the job done,” added team leader Hakim Atek, also of the Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris and lead author of the paper describing this result. “Despite their tiny size, these low-mass galaxies are prolific producers of energetic radiation, and their abundance during this period is so substantial that their collective influence can transform the entire state of the Universe.”To arrive at this conclusion, the team first combined extremely sensitive Webb imaging data with imaging of Abell 2744 from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to select extremely faint galaxy candidates in the epoch of reionisation.This was followed by spectroscopy with Webb’s Near-InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec). The instrument’s Multi-Shutter Assembly was used to capture several spectra of these faint galaxies. This is the first time scientists have reliably estimated how common faint galaxies are. The results confirm that they are the most abundant type of galaxies during the epoch of reionisation. This also marks the first time that the ionising power of these galaxies has been measured, enabling the astronomers to determine that they are producing sufficient energetic radiation to ionise the early Universe.“The incredible sensitivity of NIRSpec combined with the gravitational amplification provided by Abell 2744 enabled us to identify and study these galaxies from the first billion years of the Universe in detail, despite their being over 100 times fainter than our own Milky Way,” continued Hakim.In an upcoming Webb observing programme, named GLIMPSE, scientists will obtain the most sensitive observations ever done on the sky. By targeting another galaxy cluster, named Abell S1063, even fainter galaxies during the epoch of reionisation will be identified. This will allow scientists to verify whether the dwarf galaxies in the current study are typical of the large-scale distribution of galaxies. As these new results are based on observations obtained in one field, the team notes that the ionising properties of faint galaxies can appear differently if they reside in denser regions.Additional observations in a different field will therefore provide further insights and help verify these conclusions. The GLIMPSE observations will also help astronomers probe the period known as cosmic dawn, when the Universe was only a few million years old, to improve our understanding of the emergence of the first galaxies. These results have been published today in the journal Nature. Notes [1] Theory predicts that the first stars were 30 to 300 times more massive as our Sun and millions of times brighter, burning for only a few million years before exploding as supernovae. The energetic ultraviolet light from these first stars was capable of splitting hydrogen atoms back into electrons and protons (or ionising them). This era, from the end of the dark ages to when the Universe was around a billion years old, is known as the epoch of reionisation. This is the period when most of the neutral hydrogen was reionised by the increasing radiation from the first massive stars. Reionisation is an important phenomenon in our Universe''s history as it presents one of the few means by which we can (indirectly) study these earliest stars and galaxies. [2] Gravitational lensing occurs when a massive celestial body – such as a galaxy cluster – causes a sufficient curvature of spacetime for the path of light around it to be visibly bent, as if by a lens. The body causing the light to curve is accordingly called a gravitational lens. According to Einstein’s general theory of relativity, time and space are fused together in a quantity known as spacetime. Within this theory, massive objects cause spacetime to curve, and gravity is simply the curvature of spacetime. As light travels through spacetime, the theory predicts that the path taken by the light will also be curved by an object’s mass. Gravitational lensing is a dramatic and observable example of Einstein''s theory in action. Extremely massive celestial bodies such as galaxy clusters cause spacetime to be significantly curved. In other words, they act as gravitational lenses. When light from a more distant light source passes by a gravitational lens, the path of the light is curved, and a distorted image of the distant object results.

The terrain surrounding Mars’s north pole, known as Planum Boreum, is fascinating. The pole itself is covered in layers and layers of fine dust and water ice; these stack several kilometres thick and stretch out for around 1000 km (approximately the width of France).While most of this material is not visible here, you can see the beginnings of Planum Boreum to the right of the frame, with some subtle wrinkling showing where layers of material are starting to build up. Ground has also built up more starkly in steps, as is most clearly visible in the topographic view of this region below. The lowest altitude regions are blue/green and the highest are red/white/brown. Topography of Mars’s north polar region These layers formed as a mix of dust, water ice and frost settled on the martian ground over time. Each layer holds valuable information about Mars’s history, telling the story of how the planet’s climate has changed over the past few million years.In martian winter, the layers are topped by a thin cap of dry ice (carbon dioxide ice) a couple of metres thick. This cap completely disappears to the atmosphere each martian summer.This image comes from the Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC). Two steep banks, or escarpments, cut vertically through the frame. These mark the boundary between the aforementioned layered deposits (which stretch out of frame towards the pole, right) and the vast, sweeping dune fields covering the lower terrain of Olympia Planum (to the left).Click on the image below to explore the region and discover more about the different features you can see. Sand dunes meet stacked ice at Mars’s north pole Walls of ice Perspective view of Mars’s north polar region The left part of this image is dominated by a vast, elongated swathe of rippled sand dunes, stretching out for more than 150 km within this frame alone. This wrinkled, turbulent appearance is highly at odds with the smooth and more pristine terrain visible to the right.This smooth region lacks clear signs of erosion and has avoided being hit by incoming rocks from space – an indicator that the surface is very young, likely rejuvenating every year.Between these two extremes sit two semicircular cliffs, the larger of which is around 20 km wide. Within the curves of these cliffs sit frost-covered sand dunes. The grand scale of the cliffs is clear from the dark shadows they cast on the surface below – their steep, icy walls tower up to a kilometre high. A broader view: Olympia Planum and Planum Boreum These two cliffs are located at a so-called polar trough, a feature created as wind pushes into and wears away the surface. These show up as rippled ridges in the terrain and are common in this region, creating the distinctive spiral-like pattern of the polar plateau (seen most clearly in the wider context view of this region below, and in other images of Planum Boreum from Mars Express). Exploring Mars Mars Express has been orbiting the Red Planet since 2003. It is imaging Mars’s surface, mapping its minerals, identifying the composition and circulation of its tenuous atmosphere, probing beneath its crust, and exploring how various phenomena interact in the martian environment.The spacecraft’s HRSC, responsible for these images, has revealed much about Mars’s diverse surface in the past 20 years. Its images show everything from wind-sculpted ridges and grooves to sinkholes on the flanks of colossal volcanoes to impact craters, tectonic faults, river channels and ancient lava pools. The mission has been immensely productive over its lifetime, creating a far fuller and more accurate understanding of our planetary neighbour than ever before. Mars’s north polar region in 3D The Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) was developed and is operated by the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR).

The supernova, known as SN 1987A, occurred 160 000 light-years from Earth in the Large Magellanic Cloud. SN 1987A was observed on Earth in 1987, the first supernova that was visible to the naked eye since 1604 — before the advent of telescopes. It has offered astronomers a rare opportunity to study the evolution of a supernova and what was left behind, from the very beginning. SN 1987A was a type II, core-collapse, supernova [1], meaning that the compacted remains at its core are expected to have formed either a neutron star or a black hole. Evidence for such a compact object has long been sought. Indications for the presence of a neutron star has previously been found, but this is the first time that the effects of high energy emission from the young neutron star have been detected. Argon emission in SN1987A Astronomy typically involves the study of processes that take place over at least tens of thousands of years, far longer than all of human recorded history. Supernovae — the explosive final death throes of some massive stars — blast out within hours, and the brightness of the explosion peaks within a few months. The remains of the exploding star will continue to evolve at a rapid rate over the following decades. Thus, supernovae offer a very rare opportunity to study a key astronomical process in real time.The supernova SN 1987A was first observed on Earth in February 1987 and its brightness peaked in May that year (although its distance from Earth means that the supernova event actually took place about 160 000 years before). It was the first supernova that could be seen with the naked eye since Kepler''s Supernova in 1604.About two hours prior to the visible light observation of SN 1987A, three observatories around the world saw a burst of neutrinos lasting a few seconds [2]. The neutrino burst shortly before visible light from SN 1987A was linked to the same supernova event. This provided important clues to refine our understanding of core-collapse supernovae, Scientists suspected that this type of supernova would form a neutron star or a black hole.Astronomers have searched for evidence for one of these compact objects [3] at the centre of the expanding remnant material ever since. Indications for the presence of a neutron star at the centre of the remnant has been found in the past few years. Observations of much older supernova remnants — such as the Crab Nebula — confirm that neutron stars are found in many of these remnants. However, no direct evidence of a neutron star in the aftermath of SN 1987A (or any other such recent supernova explosion) had been observed, until now.Claes Fransson of Stockholm University, and the lead author on this study, explains: “From theoretical models of SN 1987A, the ten-second burst of neutrinos observed just before the supernova implied that a neutron star or black hole was formed in the explosion. But we have not observed any compelling signature of such a newborn object from any supernova explosion. With Webb, we have now found direct evidence for emission triggered by the newborn compact object, most likely a neutron star.” Webb began science observations in July 2022, and the observations behind this work were taken on 16 July, making the SN 1987A remnant one the first objects observed by Webb. The team used the Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) mode of Webb’s MIRI instrument, which the members of the same team helped to develop. The MRS is a type of instrument known as an Integral Field Unit (IFU). IFUs are able to image an object and take a spectrum of it at the same time. The instrument captures a spectrum at each pixel, allowing observers to see spectroscopic differences across the object. Spectral analysis of the results showed a strong signal due to ionised argon from the centre of the ejected material that surrounds the original site of SN 1987A.Subsequent observations using Webb’s NIRSpec (Near Infrared Spectrograph) IFU mode, at shorter wavelengths, more heavily ionised [4] chemical species, including five times ionised argon (meaning argon atoms that have lost five of their 18 electrons). Such ions require highly energetic photons to form, and those photons have to come from somewhere. “To create these ions that we observed in the ejecta, it was clear that there had to be a source of high-energy radiation in the centre of the SN 1987A remnant," Fransson said. "In the paper we discuss different possibilities, finding that only a few scenarios are likely, and all of these involve a newly born neutron star.”More observations of SN 1987A are planned this year, with Webb and ground-based telescopes. The research team hopes ongoing study will provide more clarity about exactly what is happening in the heart of this supernova remnant. These observations will hopefully spur the development of more detailed models [5], ultimately enabling astronomers to better understand not just SN 1987A, but all core-collapse supernovae. Notes[1] Type II supernovae are distinguishable from Type Ia supernovae by the presence of hydrogen in their spectra. They typically result from the core-collapse of a dying massive star with 8–25 times the mass of our Sun. Core-collapse supernovae derive their energy from gravitational potential energy and create and release far more neutrinos than the other mechanism that causes supernovae (nuclear runaway in certain binary star systems). About 99.6 % of the energy is released as neutrinos, while most the rest comes out as kinetic energy and only a tiny fraction as light. Still, they can be as bright as whole galaxy.[2] Neutrinos are a chargeless type of subatomic particle. They are extremely low in mass (about 500 000 times less massive than an electron). They interact very weakly with other matter, making them extremely challenging to detect. They are produced in abundance in core-collapse supernovae, hence the association between the observed blast of neutrinos and SN 1987A.[3] Compact objects in astronomy are extremely dense stellar remnants, including white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. The core of a neutron star is so dense that a single teaspoon of the neutron material there would weigh over three billion tons.[4] Ionisation occurs when an atom or a molecule gains or loses electrons, giving it an overall electric charge. This typically happens as a result of either collisions with other particles, or the presence of so-called ionising radiation, such as X-rays and some ultraviolet radiation.[5] Models are simplified theoretical representations of the behaviour of objects or systems, that allow scientists to predict and explain observations. They might be built on mathematical, chemical and physical principles. In astronomy, as with all sciences, both models and observations are used to develop and refine our understanding of how things work.

Euclid begins its dark Universe survey 14/02/2024 9435 views 88 likes ESA / Science & Exploration / Space Science / Euclid Today, ESA’s space telescope Euclid begins its survey of the dark Universe. Over the next six years, Euclid will observe billions of galaxies across 10 billion years of cosmic history. Learn how the team prepared Euclid in the months after launch for this gigantic cosmic quest. Euclid, one of the most precise and stable space telescopes ever built, was launched on 1 July 2023. During its first months in space, teams across Europe turned on, tested, and prepared the mission for routine science observations. However, these ‘routine’ science observations are no piece of cake. Euclid''s survey in the next six years 50 000 galaxies in one shot Euclid’s wide-eyed look at the cosmos One of Euclid’s strengths is that it can observe a large area of the sky in one shot. This is crucial for a mission whose primary objective is to map more than one third of the sky in six years. Euclid will follow a so-called ‘step-and-stare’ observation mode. This means that the telescope will stare at one area of the sky for about 70 minutes, producing images and spectra, and it then takes four minutes to move to the next area of the sky. During its entire mission, Euclid will perform more than 40 000 of these ‘pointings’. “Thanks to its wide-eyed look at the cosmos, and its long exposure time and sensitivity, the number of galaxies that Euclid can see in one pointing is huge,” explains Roberto Scaramella, Euclid survey scientist at the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) in Italy, and lead of the consortium survey group since the beginning of the mission. Roberto had to make sure that the survey was designed in such a way that it meets the science goals. A main goal for Euclid is to measure in more detail than ever before the shapes of billions of galaxies over billions of years of cosmic history, to provide a 3D view of the dark matter distribution in our Universe. “To study the individual distortions of galaxies by dark matter, we need to observe at least 1.5 billion galaxies. Euclid will observe the shapes of around 50 000 galaxies with the needed accuracy in one shot, and will spot many more faint ones,” adds Roberto. However, soon after turning Euclid’s instruments on for the first time, the team realised that the entire survey needed to be re-designed. A change in attitude Artist impression of Euclid in space The problem was that a tiny amount of unwanted sunlight was reaching Euclid''s visible instrument (VIS) at specific angles, even with the spacecraft’s sunshield (its back) turned towards the Sun. “The original plan was for Euclid to keep its sunshield facing the Sun. But soon after launch, disturbing light from the Sun was detected in the test images,” explains Ismael Tereno of the University of Lisbon, Portugal, and lead of the Euclid survey operations support team, operated with the support of the Portuguese Space Agency. “After intense troubleshooting, science, engineering, and industrial teams found that for this light to disappear, Euclid needed to observe with a different orientation (attitude) with respect to the Sun. This meant that the original survey design would no longer work. We had to quickly come up with a new strategy, implement it, and test it,” adds João Dinis, also from the University of Lisbon, Portugal who together with Ismael was responsible for the survey (re-)design. To minimise the effect of ‘stray’ sunlight, the teams found out that Euclid needs to observe with a more restricted rotation angle, such that the sunshield is not directly facing the Sun, with a small but impactful tilt in one direction. With this new restricted attitude, parts of the sky could not be reached from any point in Euclid’s orbit around L2. “It proved very difficult to find a good survey solution, and we had to go back to the drawing board,” recalls Ismael. A giant puzzle It was the start of a very intense phase for João, Ismael and the survey operations and science teams. “João quickly had the insight of what needed to be changed, and then worked around the clock to propose a workable re-design,” says Ismael. Designing the Euclid survey was a giant puzzle. Aside from the scientific goals and the angle that Euclid needed to observe from, there are many other factors that needed to be considered. Euclid’s wide and deep surveys over the next 6 years Access the video The largest fraction of the mission''s observations will be devoted to a ‘wide’ survey, covering more than one third of the sky. The wide survey is complemented by a deep survey, taking about 10% of the total observing time. Aside from that, routine calibration observations also had to be scheduled to fit the puzzle. Xavier Dupac, ESA survey scientist for the Science Operation Centre at ESAC in Spain, made sure that the survey designed by João, Ismael and the team could be executed. “For example, we need to take into account the time it takes for the spacecraft to rotate from one observing position to the next. These times need to be included in the survey design in addition to the actual observing time,” explains Xavier. In the end, the teams came up with a workable solution that meant more overlaps between adjacent observations had to be made. Euclid’s survey is now slightly less efficient, but all necessary areas of the sky can be reached and the overall loss in survey area is kept to a minimum. “The teams worked very hard to redesign the survey in a short amount of time, this is a major achievement," says Valeria Pettorino, Euclid project scientist for ESA. “And this is not the end of the story. As the mission advances and the scientific results start to arrive, the teams will continue to optimise the survey, and be ready to adapt it if needed.” Looking ahead at Euclid’s first survey year Euclid’s wide and deep surveys Today, Euclid officially started its survey. The telescope is currently scheduled to observe a patch of 130 square degrees – more than 500 times the area of the full Moon – over the course of the next 14 days. This patch is in the direction of the constellations of Caelum and Pictor in the Southern Hemisphere. In the coming year, Euclid will cover around 15% of its survey. This first year of cosmology data will be released to the community in summer 2026. A smaller data release of deep field observations is foreseen for spring 2025. About Euclid Euclid is a European mission, built and operated by ESA, with contributions from NASA. The Euclid Consortium – consisting of more than 2000 scientists from 300 institutes in 13 European countries, the US, Canada and Japan – was responsible for providing the scientific instruments and will provide the scientific data analysis. ESA selected Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor for the construction of the satellite and its service module, with Airbus Defence and Space chosen to develop the payload module, including the telescope. NASA provided the detectors of the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer, NISP. Euclid is a medium-class mission in ESA’s Cosmic Vision programme.

Parabolic flights provide this low-gravity environment by flying an aircraft over a curved trajectory called a parabola. After a heavy pull-up, the pilots inject the aircraft onto the parabolic curve. As the plane slows down, reaches its apex and falls back down, everything inside is in freefall and experiences weightlessness relative to the plane, similar to the sensation you get at the top of a rollercoaster. This short period of weightlessness lasts about 22 seconds, during which people and experiments on board the parabolic flight can experience the same weightlessness as astronauts in orbit on the International Space Station. Science with(out) gravity The price to pay for this free-floating freedom is two short periods of hypergravity during which everything weighs almost double for 20 seconds: first when the aircraft pulls up sharply to reach the weightless curve and then again when it pulls out sharply afterwards to return to a normal flight path. A lunar transport prototype is tested on a partial-gravity parabolic flight by Thomas Pesquet Each parabola takes about one minute to complete and is repeated 31 times in one flight, providing a total of about ten minutes of zero-gravity. A typical parabolic flight campaign consists of three flights, giving about 30 minutes of ''weightlessness'' over 93 parabolas.The aircraft can also fly over a gentler trajectory, providing partial gravity like on the Moon or Mars. Lunar and martian gravity levels are not only scientifically interesting but it is also useful to test the effect on humans and equipment before travelling to these destinations. How will we walk on Mars? ESA has been conducting parabolic flights since the 1980s under a contract with Novespace and their dedicated aircraft, today the A310 Zero-G, to perform at least two campaigns per year. The flights provide European scientists with access to a repeatable, low-gravity research environment. Hundreds of experiments have flown over thousands of parabolas, enabling extensive scientific endeavours across many disciplines and resulting in a huge legacy of publications. Apply now!

In-depth Ariane 6 test model during fuel line disconnection test The test model that is now on the launch pad at Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, stands 62 m high. It is exactly the same as the ‘production model’ Ariane 6 rockets that will soon be launched, except that its boosters do not need to be tested as part of the complete rocket, so the boosters are not fuelled.To make way for launch, teams from ArianeGroup, France’s space agency CNES and ESA have started to remove the Ariane 6 test model by disconnecting the cables and fuel lines that pass through the launch tower.On 30 January, the cryogenic connection system passed a last system test of the liftoff disconnection operations lines. The yellow arms seen here support the fuel lines that deliver liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to the upper stage to power the Vinci orbital engine – for this test there was no propellant in the fuel lines. Simultaneously at the bottom of the central core the connection system for the main stage also disconnected.The connection system allows the free-standing launcher a clear ascent corridor on its way to space and protects the connection systems before the rocket engines’ plumes could damage it. The disconnection during the critical and complex dynamic liftoff phase must be executed in a strict timeline that has to happen with an accuracy of just a few milliseconds.

These lines supply the launcher and the satellites inside Ariane 6 with electrical power but also host the digital signals for communications with the informatics system as well as carrying sensor information to ensure the flight system is in good shape for liftoff.Teams were most interested in seeing how the heavy lines fall away from the rocket and in particular its boosters. For this test, explosive bolts were not used but a technician manually removed the blocking pin from 50 m above the launch pad. Keep cool Ariane 6 test model upper composite on the move The test model is free from the launch tower, so further dismantling has begun. The upper composite has been removed, this includes the nosecone that splits vertically in two and the dummy payloads underneath. They have been returned to the Encapsulation Hall that is part of the Batiment Assemblage Finale. The test model will be further disassembled by removing the boosters and returning the central core to the Batiment d’Assemblage Lanceur. The test model was first seen in full in June 2023 with many tests and rehearsals having been completed since then, including successful hot-fire tests of its main stage, structure tests and fuelling rehearsals in different scenarios, including degraded scenarios for testing the most severe conditions that could occur in operations."The Ariane 6 launch system test campaign took just seven months and was within schedule," says Pier Domenico Resta, ESA’s Ariane 6 launch system and engineering manager, "This is one of the best results ever achieved for a full-scale launch test campaign and it shows testament to the teams on ground doing great work to get Ariane 6 into perfect shape and ready for launch."The larger elements for the first flight model for Ariane 6 are set to arrive soon and will start to be assembled for the inaugural launch whose schedule stays unchanged.

It paves the way for manufacturing more complex metallic structures in space. That is a key asset for securing exploration of Moon and Mars.”The printer will be printing using a type of stainless-steel commonly used in medical implants and water treatment due to its good resistance to corrosion.The stainless-steel wire is fed into the printing area, which is heated by a high-power laser, about a million times time more powerful than your average laser pointer. As the wire dips into the melt pool, the end of the wire melts and metal is then added to the print.ESA materials engineer Advenit Makaya from the ESA’s Directorate of Technology, Engineering and Quality, provided technical support to the project: “The melt pool of the print process is very small, in the order of a millimetre across, so that the liquid metal’s surface tension holds it securely in place in weightlessness. Even so, the melting point of stainless steel is about 1400 °C so the printer operates within a fully sealed box, preventing excess heat or fumes from reaching the crew of the Space Station. And before the print process begins the printer’s internal oxygen atmosphere has to be vented to space, replaced by nitrogen – the hot stainless steel would oxidise if it became exposed to the oxygen.” Shapes and sizes Metal 3D printer test print Four interesting shapes have been chosen to test the performance of the Metal 3D printer. These first objects will be compared to the same shapes printed on ground, called reference prints, to see how the space environment affects the printing process. The four prints are all smaller than a soda can in size, weigh less than 250 g per print, and takes about two to four weeks to print. The scheduled print time is limited to four hours daily, due to noise regulations on the Space Station – the printer’s fans and motor of the printer are relatively noisy.Once a shape has been printed, Andreas will remove it from the printer and pack it for safe travels back to Earth for processing and analysis, to understand the differences in printing quality and performance in space, as opposed to Earth.One reference and 0xg print, which is a part of a dedicated tool, will go to the European Astronaut Centre (EAC) in Cologne, Germany. Another two will be headed to the technical heart of ESA, the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), where a team at the Materials and Electrical Components Laboratory awaits the samples for macro and micro analysis of the printed parts. The final print will go to the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), who proposed its shape, and will investigate its thermal properties in support of e.g. future antenna alignment. Preparing for the future “As a technology demonstration project, our aim is to prove the potential of metal 3D printing in space,” adds Rob. “We’ve already learned a lot getting to this point and hope to learn a lot more, on the way to making in-space manufacturing and assembly a practical proposition.”One of ESA’s goals for future development is to create a circular space economy and recycle materials in orbit to allow for a better use of resources. One way would be to repurpose bits from old satellites into new tools or structures. The 3D printer would eliminate the need to send a tool up with a rocket and allow the astronauts to print the needed parts in orbit.Tommaso Ghidini, Head of the Mechanical Department at ESA, notes: “Metal 3D in space printing is a promising capability to support future exploration activities, but also beyond, to contribute to more sustainable space activities, through in-situ manufacturing, repair and perhaps recycling of space structures, for a wide range of applications. This includes in-orbit large infrastructure manufacturing and assembly as well as planetary long-term human settlement. These aspects are key focuses in ESA''s upcoming technology cross-cutting initiatives.” Thomas Rohr, overseeing ESA''s Materials and Processes Section, adds: “This technology demonstration, showcasing the processing of metallic materials in microgravity, paves the way for future endeavours to manufacture infrastructure beyond the confines of Earth.” Read more about Andreas and the science on the Huginn page.

This new set of exquisite images show stars, gas, and dust on the smallest scales ever observed beyond our own galaxy.Teams of researchers are studying these images to uncover the origins of these intricate structures. The research community’s collective analysis will ultimately inform theorists’ simulations, and advance our understanding of star formation and the evolution of spiral galaxies. 12345678910PreviousNext If you follow each of the galaxy’s clearly defined arms, which are brimming with stars, to their centres, there may be old star clusters and – sometimes – active supermassive black holes. Only the James Webb Space Telescope can deliver highly detailed scenes of nearby galaxies in a combination of near- and mid-infrared light – and a set of these images were publicly released today.These Webb images are part of a large, long-standing project, the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) programme, which is supported by more than 150 astronomers worldwide. Before Webb took these images, PHANGS was already brimming with data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, the Very Large Telescope’s Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), including observations in ultraviolet, visible, and radio light. Webb’s near- and mid-infrared contributions have provided several new puzzle pieces.Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) captured millions of stars in these images, which sparkle in blue tones. Some stars are spread throughout the spiral arms, but others are clumped tightly together in star clusters.The telescope’s MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) data highlights glowing dust, showing us where it exists behind, around, and between stars. It also spotlights stars that haven’t yet fully formed – they are still encased in the gas and dust that feed their growth, like bright red seeds at the tips of dusty peaks. To the amazement of astronomers, Webb’s images also show large, spherical shells in the gas and dust that may have been created by exploded stars.The spiral arms’ extended regions of gas also reveal details in red and orange. Astronomers study the spacing of these features to learn how a galaxy distributes its gas and dust. These structures will provide key insights about how galaxies build, maintain, and shut off star formation.Evidence shows that galaxies grow from inside out – star formation begins at galaxies’ cores and spreads along their arms, spiralling away from the centre. The farther a star is from the galaxy’s core, the more likely it is to be younger. In contrast, the areas near the cores that look lit by a blue spotlight are populations of older stars. The galaxy cores that are awash in pink-and-red diffraction spikes may indicate an active supermassive black hole or saturation from bright star clusters toward the centre.There are many avenues of research that scientists can begin to pursue with the combined PHANGS data, but the unprecedented number of stars Webb resolved are a great place to begin. In addition to immediately releasing these images, the PHANGS team has also released the largest catalogue to date of roughly 100 000 star clusters. More informationWebb is the largest, most powerful telescope ever launched into space. Under an international collaboration agreement, ESA provided the telescope’s launch service, using the Ariane 5 launch vehicle. Working with partners, ESA was responsible for the development and qualification of Ariane 5 adaptations for the Webb mission and for the procurement of the launch service by Arianespace. ESA also provided the workhorse spectrograph NIRSpec and 50% of the mid-infrared instrument MIRI, which was designed and built by a consortium of nationally funded European Institutes (The MIRI European Consortium) in partnership with JPL and the University of Arizona.Webb is an international partnership between NASA, ESA and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).All image files for the 19 galaxies can be downloaded here.

At only approximately twice Earth’s diameter, the planet GJ 9827d could be an example of potential planets with water-rich atmospheres elsewhere in our galaxy. “This would be the first time that we can directly show through an atmospheric detection that these planets with water-rich atmospheres can actually exist around other stars,” said team member Björn Benneke of the Université de Montréal. “This is an important step toward determining the prevalence and diversity of atmospheres on rocky planets."However, it remains too early to tell whether Hubble spectroscopically measured a small amount of water vapour in a puffy hydrogen-rich atmosphere, or if the planet’s atmosphere is mostly made of water, left behind after a primaeval hydrogen/helium atmosphere evapourated under stellar radiation.“Our observing programme was designed specifically with the goal of not only detecting the molecules in the planet’s atmosphere, but of actually looking specifically for water vapour. Either result would be exciting, whether water vapour is dominant or just a tiny species in a hydrogen-dominant atmosphere,” said the science paper’s lead author, Pierre-Alexis Roy of the Université de Montréal.“Until now, we had not been able to directly detect the atmosphere of such a small planet. And we’re slowly getting into this regime now,” added Björn. “At some point, as we study smaller planets, there must be a transition where there’s no more hydrogen on these small worlds, and they have atmospheres more like Venus (which is dominated by carbon dioxide)."Because the planet is as hot as Venus at roughly 425 degrees Celcius, it definitely would be an inhospitable, steamy world if the atmosphere were predominantly water vapour.At present the team is left with two possibilities. The planet is still clinging to a hydrogen-rich envelope laced with water, making it a mini-Neptune. Alternatively, it could be a warmer version of Jupiter’s moon Europa, which has twice as much water as Earth beneath its crust. “The planet GJ 9827d could be half water, half rock. And there would be a lot of water vapour on top of some smaller rocky body,” said Björn.If the planet has a residual water-rich atmosphere, then it must have formed farther away from its host star, where the temperature is cold and water is available in the form of ice, than its present location. In this scenario, the planet would have then migrated closer to the star and received more radiation. The hydrogen was then heated and escaped, or is still in the process of escaping, the planet’s weak gravity. The alternative theory is that the planet formed close to the hot star, with a trace of water in its atmosphere.The Hubble programme observed the planet during 11 transits – events in which the planet crossed in front of its star – that were spaced out over three years. During transits, starlight is filtered through the planet’s atmosphere and carries the spectral fingerprint of water molecules. If there are clouds on the planet, they are low enough in the atmosphere that they don’t completely hide Hubble’s view of the atmosphere, and Hubble is able to probe water vapour above the clouds.Hubble’s discovery opens the door to studying the planet in more detail. It’s a good target for the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope to do infrared spectroscopy to look for other atmospheric molecules.GJ 9827d was discovered by NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope in 2017. It completes an orbit around a red dwarf star every 6.2 days. The star, GJ 9827, lies 97 light-years from Earth in the constellation Pisces.

This important step, formally called ‘adoption’, recognises that the mission concept and technology are sufficiently advanced, and gives the go-ahead to build the instruments and spacecraft. This work will start in January 2025 once a European industrial contractor has been chosen.LISA is not just one spacecraft but a constellation of three. They will trail Earth in its orbit around the Sun, forming an exquisitely accurate equilateral triangle in space. Each side of the triangle will be 2.5 million km long (more than six times the Earth-Moon distance), and the spacecraft will exchange laser beams over this distance. The launch of the three spacecraft is planned for 2035, on an Ariane 6 rocket.Led by ESA, LISA is made possible by a collaboration between ESA, its Member State space agencies, NASA, and an international consortium of scientists (the LISA consortium). LISA – measuring gravitational waves Bringing ‘sound’ to the cosmic movie Just over a century ago, Einstein made the revolutionary prediction that when massive objects accelerate, they shake the fabric of spacetime, producing miniscule ripples known as gravitational waves. Thanks to modern technological developments, we are now able to detect these most elusive of signals.“LISA is an endeavour that has never been tried before. Using laser beams over distances of several kilometres, ground-based instrumentation can detect gravitational waves coming from events involving star-sized objects – such as supernova explosions or merging of hyper-dense stars and stellar-mass black holes. To expand the frontier of gravitational studies we must go to space,” explains LISA lead project scientist Nora Lützgendorf.“Thanks to the huge distance travelled by the laser signals on LISA, and the superb stability of its instrumentation, we will probe gravitational waves of lower frequencies than is possible on Earth, uncovering events of a different scale, all the way back to the dawn of time.” The spectrum of gravitational waves LISA will detect, across the entire Universe, the ripples in spacetime caused when huge black holes at the centres of galaxies collide. This will enable scientists to trace the origin of these monstrous objects, to chart how they grow to be millions of times more massive than the Sun and to establish the role they play in the evolution of galaxies.The mission is poised to capture the predicted gravitational ‘ringing’ from the initial moments of our Universe and offer a direct glimpse into the very first seconds after the Big Bang. Additionally, because gravitational waves carry information on the distance of the objects that emitted them, LISA will help researchers measure the change in the expansion of the Universe with a different type of yardstick from the techniques used by Euclid and other surveys, validating their results.Closer to home, in our own galaxy, LISA will detect many merging pairs of compact objects like white dwarfs or neutron stars and give us a unique insight into the final stages of the evolution of these systems. By pinpointing their position and distances, LISA will further our grasp of the structure of the Milky Way, building upon the findings from ESA''s Gaia mission.“For centuries we have been studying our cosmos through capturing light. Coupling this with the detection of gravitational waves is bringing a totally new dimension to our perception of the Universe,” remarks LISA project scientist Oliver Jennrich.“If we imagine that, so far, with our astrophysics missions, we have been watching the cosmos like a silent movie, capturing the ripples of spacetime with LISA will be a real game-changer, like when sound was added to motion pictures.” Golden cubes and laser beams Golden cubes for LISA To detect gravitational waves, LISA will use pairs of solid gold-platinum cubes – so called test masses (slightly smaller than Rubik’s cubes), free-floating in special housing at the heart of each spacecraft. Gravitational waves will cause tiny changes in the distances between the masses in the different spacecraft, and the mission will track these variations using laser interferometry.This technique requires shooting laser beams from one spacecraft to the other and then superimposing their signal to determine changes in the masses’ distances down to a few billionths of a millimetre.The spacecraft must be designed to ensure that nothing, besides the geometry of spacetime itself, affects the movement of the masses, which are in freefall. Solid heritage and future teamwork The spacecraft follows in the footsteps of LISA Pathfinder, which demonstrated that it is possible to keep the test masses in freefall to an astonishing level of precision. The same precision propulsion system that has also been flown on ESA’s Gaia and Euclid missions will ensure that each spacecraft maintains the required position and orientation with the highest accuracy.Selected to be the third large mission of ESA’s Cosmic Vision 2015–2025, LISA will join ESA’s science fleet of cosmic observers to address two essential questions at the heart of the programme: What are the fundamental physical laws of the Universe? How did the Universe originate and what is it made of?In this quest, LISA will work together with ESA’s other large mission currently under study: NewAthena. With a launch date foreseen for 2037, NewAthena is set to be the largest X-ray observatory ever built.Notes for editorsESA leads the LISA mission and will provide the spacecraft, launch, mission operations and data handling. Key instrumental elements are the free-falling test masses shielded from external forces, provided by Italy and Switzerland; the picometre-accuracy systems to detect the interferometric signal, provided by Germany, the UK, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland and the Czech Republic; and the Science Diagnostics Subsystem (an arsenal of sensors across the spacecraft), provided by Spain.

Envision will study Venus from its inner core to its outer atmosphere, giving important new insight into the planet''s history, geological activity and climate. Being adopted means that the study phase is complete and ESA commits to implementing the mission. Following selection of the European industrial contractor later this year, work will soon begin to finalise the design and build the spacecraft. Envision is foreseen to launch on an Ariane 6 rocket in 2031.“Since the mission was selected back in 2021, we have advanced from broad science goals to a concrete mission plan,” says ESA Envision study manager Thomas Voirin. “We’re very excited about moving to the next step. Envision will answer longstanding open questions about Venus, arguably the least understood of the Solar System’s terrestrial planets.”Venus is Earth’s closest neighbour – much closer than Mars – and very similar to our home planet in mass and size. Unlike Earth, however, it is not a pleasant place to visit. Of the Solar System’s rocky bodies, it has the densest atmosphere, and it is completely covered by layers of thick clouds made mostly of sulphuric acid. The surface of Venus is a scorching 464 °C on average, with a crushing air pressure 92 times bigger than we experience on Earth’s surface. This leaves us to wonder: how and when did Earth’s twin become so inhospitable? Science with Envision The measurements Envision makes will help unravel key mysteries of our hot neighbour. For example, Envision will reveal how volcanoes, plate tectonics and asteroid impacts have shaped the Venusian surface, and how geologically active the planet is today. The mission will also investigate the planet''s insides, collecting data on the structure and thickness of Venus''s core, mantle and crust. Lastly, it will study the weather and climate on Venus, including how they are affected by geological activity on the ground. Envision science: what will the mission observe? “Special to Envision is the mission’s approach to studying the entire planet as a system. It will investigate Venus’s surface, interior and atmosphere with unprecedented accuracy, allowing us to understand how they work and interact with each other. For example, Envision will use multiple measurement techniques to search for signatures of active volcanism at the surface and in the atmosphere,” explains Anne Grete Straume-Lindner, the mission’s project scientist.To enable this holistic investigation, Envision will carry an extensive set of scientific instruments. It will be the first mission to directly probe beneath Venus’s surface, using its subsurface radar sounder. A second radar instrument, VenSAR, will map the surface with a resolution down to 10 metres and determine properties such as surface texture. Three different spectrometers will study the make-up of the surface and atmosphere. And a radio science experiment will use radio waves to study the planet’s internal structure and properties of the atmosphere. Envision studying the surface of Venus Access the video Strong heritage and fruitful cooperationEnvision will join ESA’s science fleet of Solar System explorers. These missions address two top-level science themes of ESA’s Cosmic Vision 2015–2025, namely: What are the conditions for planet formation and the emergence of life? and How does the Solar System work? It will be the second European mission to Venus. ESA’s Venus Express (2005–2014) focused on the planet’s atmosphere, but also made dramatic discoveries that pointed to possible volcanic hotspots on the planet’s surface. (Read more about the science highlights of Venus Express here.) The study of the atmosphere has continued with JAXA''s Akatsuki mission, which is still actively tracking atmospheric movement and Venusian weather. Longer ago, NASA''s Mariner and Pioneer Venus missions (1960s and 1970s), the Soviet Union''s Venera and Vega missions (1960s to 1980s), and NASA''s Magellan radar mapping mission (1990–1994) painted a picture of a dry world, with landscapes shaped by volcanoes and intense geological activity. They discovered vast plains marked by lava flows, bordered by highlands and mountains. Envision’s VenSAR instrument, expected to be contributed by NASA, will map the Venusian surface at a much higher resolution than Magellan, distinguishing surface features more than ten times smaller. Read more about past missions to Venus Envision targets on Venus''s surface This time around, Envision will not be alone on its trip to Venus. Expecting a fruitful collaboration, NASA has also selected two new missions to Venus as part of its Discovery Program: DAVINCI (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging) and VERITAS (Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy). Together, Envision, DAVINCI and VERITAS will provide the most comprehensive study of Venus ever. Notes for Editors:Envision is an ESA-led mission in partnership with NASA. NASA is expected to provide the VenSAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) instrument, as well as Deep Space Network support. The other payload instruments are contributed by ESA member states, with ASI, DLR, BelSPO, and CNES respectively leading the procurement of the Subsurface Sounding Radar (SRS) and the VenSpec-M, VenSpec-H and VenSpec-U spectrometers.

In-depth Bert, DLR''s robot dog ready to explore. In a room in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, there were three robots. There was equipment all around them and a team of engineers waiting for one person to take the next step in operating robots from space: Marcus Wandt.The experiment is called Surface Avatar and is a collaboration between ESA and the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) to build a team of robots and an intuitive interface for the astronauts to operate them from afar."During his training, Marcus provided us with feedback of the robotic operations for Surface Avatar. This is a unique opportunity to have more astronauts test the robots and the interface we have developed,” said Thomas Krueger, head of ESA’s Human Robot Interaction Lab. “Working together with DLR on this project is great. We are sharing lessons learned and making something bigger than the sum of its parts.” added Thomas. Choreograph robots from space Photo from Marcus''s training prior to launch. Ready at the controls on the Space Station, Marcus used the sigma 7 controller. The tool offers seven degrees of freedom and haptic feedback that allowed Marcus feel when the robot’s arm bumped into the objects in front of it.In front of Marcus was also a screen with video feed from the robots, with the interface overlaying the live video. The Swedish astronaut could simply click on a button on the screen and change the speed of the robot’s movement, or switch between the video feeds from the different robots.Marcus already got a taste of the Surface Avatar experiment when he visited ESA’s technical heart in the Netherlands, European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), half a year ago.“While Marcus familiarised himself with the equipment of Surface Avatar during training on Earth, the exact task he had to complete today on the Space Station was new to him. That is the idea of the experiment: to test our intuitive interface with the robots and see how the astronaut works with the robots,” said Thomas. Putting the pieces together Two robots working together The three robots were Bert and Rollin’ Justin from DLR and ESA’s Interact rover. With those at his hands, Marcus went to work by looking for three objects with the little robot dog Bert, using the cameras on Bert and on Rollin’ Justin. The footage from Bert and Justin gave him an overview of the scene.After successfully finding two aliens and a doll, he moved on to the next task: getting a peg in a hole with two robots working together. With both the Interact Rover and Rollin’ Justin having an arm on the peg, Marcus made sure Rollin’ Justin allowed the Interact rover arm to steer the peg in the hole, while Rollin’ Justin supported the peg. Getting the two robots to work together was no problem for Marcus, and he manoeuvred the peg into the hole using the arm of the Interact Rover.Lastly, he used Rollin’ Justin to lift a handle, a task that might seem easy for a human, but for a robot it is not a simple one. The handle is attached at the end, so if Rollin’ Justin just lifted the handle straight up, the robot would lose the grip of the handle, since it would rotate away from Rollin’ Justin. After some small technical difficulties were ironed out by the Surface Avatar team in real time, Marcus managed to lift and lower the handle.The experiment ended with Marcus providing valuable feedback to the Surface Avatar team, so they can improve the interface and pave the way for future sessions.“Now it is time to go over all the feedback Marcus provided. It was a successful run of Surface Avatar and it is clear that Marcus has experience with working on new and unfamiliar equipment” said Dr. Neal Lii, Domain Head at DLR’s Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics. From the Space Station to the Moon and beyond Terrae Novae destinations The success of the Surface Avatar run with Marcus paves the way for future space exploration. When humankind returns to the Moon, a robot companion may be a good substitute for going on long moonwalks. If the astronauts could operate one or more robots from the safety of a lunar lander, the robot could scout out new areas or perform more mundane tasks, such as collecting rocks samples.“The use of robotics is fundamental in all the phases of Moon exploration as defined in the Terrae Novae strategy, from the initial uncrewed missions to crewed missions where robotics will support astronauts. In the future, full autonomous robots will handle tasks using artificial intelligence, said Giorgio Magistrati, team leader for the Exploration Preparation, Research and Technology team at ESA.Visit the Muninn page for more information on Marcus’s mission and check out his social media for updates about life and work on the Space Station.

I want to thank ESA for being bold and forward-thinking, and for paving the way to strengthen Europe’s presence in space with the support of Sweden and Axiom Space,” said Marcus on launch day.As a project astronaut, Marcus’s job at ESA is linked to this specific flight opportunity on a fixed-term contract. Two Scandinavians in orbit The Muninn mission officially began as a ’weightless’ Marcus went through the hatch of the Space Station’s Harmony module at 12:16 GMT (13:16 CET). Welcome ceremony for Axiom 3 Marcus’s first mission to space takes its name from Norse mythology and the two raven accomplices of the god Odin – Muninn and Huginn. According to the myth, the ravens serve as messengers and advisors to their god, sharing all they see and hear. Huginn is the mission name of Danish ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen.Marcus was welcomed aboard by Andreas, who is currently commander of the Space Station. This is the first time two Scandinavians are together in space, ready to gather new knowledge in orbit, deliver benefits to people on Earth and prepare for future space exploration. Action-packed mission Marcus will devote much of his time in space to scientific activities and technology demonstrations that could shape the way we live and work on Earth. In total, he will run around 20 experiments and take part in five educational programmes on the Space Station. Marcus training on Space Station mockup The Muninn programme is packed with European research and new experiments led by the Swedish Space Agency, ranging from studies into how the design of space habitats affects an astronaut’s stress levels to unravelling the changes in cellular structures and gene expression in microgravity.

Although the spacecraft was not able to land on the lunar surface, ESA’s Exospheric Mass Spectrometer, the heart of a joint NASA and ESA instrument onboard destined to sniff the Moon’s surface, was able to demonstrate full functionality in space. Astrobotic''s Peregrine launches to the Moon The Peregrine lunar lander launched towards the Moon on 8 January at 07:18 GMT on the inaugural flight of United Launch Alliance’s new Vulcan rocket. Around 50 minutes after the launch and 500 km above the Earth’s surface, Peregrine separated from the rocket and powered on. Initially, the mission planned for the lander to touchdown on the lunar surface on 23 February, delivering scientific instruments to the Gruithuisen Domes region near the north pole of the Moon. These instruments included the Peregrine Ion-Trap Mass Spectrometer (PITMS) of which ESA’s Exospheric Mass Spectrometer (EMS) is the heart. PITMS was designed to sniff the Moon’s tenuous atmosphere to chart its chemical composition. Peregrine in space However, a few hours into the mission, the Astrobotic team discovered a propulsion anomaly causing a critical loss of propellant, which meant there was no chance of a soft landing on the Moon as planned. Therefore, the mission changed to gathering as much data as possible from the instruments onboard while in orbit between the Moon and Earth. On 11 January, Astrobotic confirmed that PITMS was one of the payloads that successfully powered on and communicated with the lander. Since then, the combined teams from ESA, The Open University, RAL Space and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center have been working day and night to “checkout and commission” the mass spectrometer, making sure the instrument operated as it should have done on the lunar surface.“We were able to power on our instrument and checked everything was functioning as it should, then we started gathering data. We were very happy to see that the data confirmed our instrument was in good health, that it survived the launch and harsh conditions of space, and that the instrument could provide clean data,” says Roland Trautner, ESA’s EMS project manager. Mini mass spectrometer on Peregrine Roland continues, “The team is very proud of what we have managed to achieve. EMS was developed not only as a cutting-edge scientific instrument, but also as a technology demonstrator, and back in 2020 we defined our success criteria for the mission in line with this. Therefore, what we have achieved today – developing the spectrometer in half the typical time, delivering our instrument to NASA after successful qualification for flight in 2021, followed by the recent successful checkout of the instrument in orbit – constitutes more than 90% of our project’s goals.”Simeon Barber, the EMS Principal Investigator at The Open University, agrees. “The successful development of EMS opens new opportunities for our instrument. With EMS as a proven instrument concept, we are very well positioned for future flight opportunities, not only on landers but also on lunar rovers.”“The success of EMS is also a testament of the good collaboration between the space agencies, industry and academia,” says Chris Howe, the EMS lead engineer at RAL Space. “The short development time would not have been possible without an efficient and trustful working relationship between those entities.”The PITMS instrument is a collaboration between ESA and NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, where ESA and its contractors, The Open University and RAL Space, provided the Exospheric Mass Spectrometer at the heart of the instrument.

ESA’s Mars Express has revisited one of Mars’s most mysterious features to clarify its composition. Its findings suggest layers of water ice stretching several kilometres below ground – the most water ever found in this part of the planet. Over 15 years ago, Mars Express studied the Medusae Fossae Formation (MFF), revealing massive deposits up to 2.5 km deep. From these early observations, it was unclear what the deposits were made of – but new research now has an answer. Mars surface height map showing the location of the MFF “We’ve explored the MFF again using newer data from Mars Express’s MARSIS radar, and found the deposits to be even thicker than we thought: up to 3.7 km thick,” says Thomas Watters of the Smithsonian Institution, USA, lead author of both the new research and the initial 2007 study. “Excitingly, the radar signals match what we’d expect to see from layered ice, and are similar to the signals we see from Mars’s polar caps, which we know to be very ice rich.”If melted, the ice locked up in the MFF would cover the entire planet in a layer of water 1.5 to 2.7 m deep: the most water ever found in this part of Mars, and enough to fill Earth’s Red Sea. Map of potential ice thickness in the MFF Alternating layers of ice The MFF consists of several wind-sculpted features measuring hundreds of kilometres across and several kilometres high. Found at the boundary between Mars’s highlands and lowlands, the features are possibly the biggest single source of dust on Mars, and one of the most extensive deposits on the planet. Mars Express radar image (black and white) showing layers of dry material and possible ice in the MFF below the surface Initial observations from Mars Express showed the MFF to be relatively transparent to radar and low in density, both characteristics we’d see from icy deposits. However, scientists couldn’t rule out a drier possibility: that the features are actually giant accumulations of windblown dust, volcanic ash or sediment. Layers of ice-free dust and possible ice below Mars’s surface (illustration) “Here’s where the new radar data comes in! Given how deep it is, if the MFF was simply a giant pile of dust, we’d expect it to become compacted under its own weight,” says co-author Andrea Cicchetti of the National Institute for Astrophysics, Italy. “This would create something far denser than what we actually see with MARSIS. And when we modelled how different ice-free materials would behave, nothing reproduced the properties of the MFF – we need ice.”The new results instead suggest layers of dust and ice, all topped by a protective layer of dry dust or ash several hundred metres thick. Future exploration and collaboration Although Mars now appears to be an arid world, the planet’s surface is full of signs that water was once abundant, including dried-up river channels, ancient ocean and lake beds, and water-carved valleys. We’ve also found significant stores of water ice on Mars, such as the enormous polar caps, buried glaciers nearer the equator, and near-surface ice laced through martian soil.Massive stores of ice near the equator – such as those suspected to lurk below the dry surface of the MFF – couldn’t have formed in the planet’s present climate. They must have formed in a previous climate epoch. View of the MFF from Mars Express’s High-Resolution Stereo Camera “This latest analysis challenges our understanding of the Medusae Fossae Formation, and raises as many questions as answers,” says Colin Wilson, ESA project scientist for Mars Express and the ESA ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). “How long ago did these ice deposits form, and what was Mars like at that time? If confirmed to be water ice, these massive deposits would change our understanding of Mars climate history. Any reservoir of ancient water would be a fascinating target for human or robotic exploration.”The extent and location of these icy MFF deposits would also make them potentially very valuable for our future exploration of Mars. Missions to Mars will need to land near the planet’s equator, far from the ice-rich polar caps or high-latitude glaciers. And they’ll need water as a resource – so finding ice in this region is almost a necessity for human missions to the planet.“Unfortunately, these MFF deposits are covered by hundreds of metres of dust, making them inaccessible for at least the next few decades. However, every bit of ice we find helps us build a better picture of where Mars’s water has flowed before, and where it can be found today.” Eumenides Dorsum, suspected to contain the thickest MFF ice-rich deposit While Mars Express maps water ice to a depth of a few kilometres, a view of near-surface water is provided by Mars orbiter TGO. This orbiter is carrying the FREND instrument, which is mapping hydrogen – an indicator of water ice – in the topmost metre of martian soil. FREND spotted a hydrogen-rich area the size of the Netherlands within Mars’s Valles Marineris in 2021, and is currently mapping how shallow water deposits are distributed across the Red Planet.“Together, our Mars explorers are revealing more and more about our planetary neighbour,” adds Colin.

Now, the unmatched resolution and sensitivity of Webb’s NIRCam instrument have revealed, for the first time, what lies in the local environment of galaxies in the very early Universe.This has solved one of the most puzzling mysteries in astronomy – why astronomers detect light from hydrogen atoms that should have been entirely blocked by the pristine gas that formed after the Big Bang. These new Webb observations have found small, faint objects surrounding the very galaxies that show the ‘inexplicable’ hydrogen emission. In conjunction with state-of-the-art simulations of galaxies in the early Universe, the observations have shown that the chaotic merging of these neighbouring galaxies is the source of this hydrogen emission. Zooming in on three neighbouring galaxies (NIRCam image) Light travels at a finite speed (300 000 km a second), which means that the further away a galaxy is, the longer it has taken the light from it to reach our Solar System. As a result, not only do observations of the most distant galaxies probe the far reaches of the Universe, but they also allow us to study the Universe as it was in the past.In order to study the very early Universe, astronomers require exceptionally powerful telescopes that are capable of observing very distant – and therefore very faint – galaxies. One of Webb’s key capabilities is its ability to observe those very distant galaxies, and hence to probe the early history of the Universe. An international team of astronomers have put Webb’s amazing capacity to excellent use in solving a long-standing mystery in astronomy.The very earliest galaxies were sites of vigorous and active star formation, and as such were rich sources of a type of light emitted by hydrogen atoms called Lyman-α emission [1]. However, during the epoch of reionisation [2] an immense amount of neutral hydrogen gas surrounded these areas of active star formation (also known as stellar nurseries). Furthermore, the space between galaxies was filled by more of this neutral gas than is the case today. The gas can very effectively absorb and scatter this kind of hydrogen emission [3], so astronomers have long predicted that the abundant Lyman-α emission released in the very early Universe should not be observable today.This theory has not always stood up to scrutiny, however, as examples of very early hydrogen emission have previously been observed by astronomers. This has presented a mystery: how is it that this hydrogen emission – which should have long since been absorbed or scattered – is being observed? Researcher at the University of Cambridge and principal investigator on the new study Callum Witten elaborates:“One of the most puzzling issues that previous observations presented was the detection of light from hydrogen atoms in the very early Universe, which should have been entirely blocked by the pristine neutral gas that was formed after the Big Bang. Many hypotheses have previously been suggested to explain the great escape of this ‘inexplicable’ emission.” A close-in view of three neighbouring galaxies (NIRCam image) The team’s breakthrough came thanks to Webb’s extraordinary combination of angular resolution and sensitivity. The observations with Webb’s NIRCam instrument were able to resolve smaller, fainter galaxies that surround the bright galaxies from which the ‘inexplicable’ hydrogen emission had been detected. In other words, the surroundings of these galaxies appear to be a much busier place than we previously thought, filled with small, faint galaxies. Crucially, these smaller galaxies were interacting and merging with one another, and Webb has revealed that galaxy mergers play an important role in explaining the mystery emission from the earliest galaxies. Sergio Martin-Alvarez, team member from Stanford University, adds:“Where Hubble was seeing only a large galaxy, Webb sees a cluster of smaller interacting galaxies, and this revelation has had a huge impact on our understanding of the unexpected hydrogen emission from some of the first galaxies.”The team then used state-of-the-art computer simulations to explore the physical processes that might explain their results. They found that the rapid build-up of stellar mass through galaxy mergers both drove strong hydrogen emission and facilitated the escape of that radiation via channels cleared of the abundant neutral gas. So the high merger rate of the previously unobserved smaller galaxies presented a compelling solution to the long-standing puzzle of the ‘inexplicable’ early hydrogen emission.The team is planning follow up observations with galaxies at various stages of merging, in order to continue to develop their understanding of how the hydrogen emission is ejected from these changing systems. Ultimately, this will enable them to improve our understanding of galaxy evolution. These findings have been published today in Nature Astronomy. Notes [1] Lyman-α emission is light emitted at a wavelength of 121.567 nanometres when the electron in an excited hydrogen atom drops from an excited state in the n = 2 orbital down to its ground state n = 1 (the lowest energy state the atom can have). Quantum physics dictates that electrons can only exist in very specific energy states, and this means that certain energy transitions – such as when the electron in a hydrogen atom drops from orbital n = 2 to n = 1 – can be identified by the wavelength of the light emitted during that transition. Lyman-α emission is important in many branches of astronomy, partly because hydrogen is so abundant in the Universe, and also because hydrogen is typically excited by energetic processes such as ongoing active star formation. Accordingly, Lyman-α emission can be used as a sign that active star formation is taking place. [2] The epoch of reionisation was a very early stage in the Universe’s history that took place after recombination (the first stage following the Big Bang). During recombination, the Universe cooled enough that electrons and protons began to combine to form neutral hydrogen atoms. During reionisation, denser clouds of gas started to form, creating stars and eventually entire galaxies whose light gradually reionised the hydrogen gas.. [3] Neutral hydrogen gas is made of hydrogen atoms that are in the lowest energy state they can be, each with their electron in orbital n = 1. Since the light emitted by a hydrogen atom during Lyman-α emission carries the energy of the atomic transition from orbital n = 2 down to n = 1, when it strikes a neutral hydrogen atom, it has exactly the right amount of energy to ionise the atom and take its electron up to the next available orbital. This means the neutral gas absorbs and blocks Lyman-α emission very easily. More informationWebb is the largest, most powerful telescope ever launched into space. Under an international collaboration agreement, ESA provided the telescope’s launch service, using the Ariane 5 launch vehicle.

It possesses the first dust disc imaged around another star – a disc of debris produced by collisions between asteroids, comets, and planetesimals. Observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope revealed a second debris disc in this system [1], inclined with respect to the first. Now, a team of astronomers using the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope to image the Beta Pictoris (Beta Pic) system has discovered a new, previously unseen structure. Star system Beta Pictoris (MIRI image) The team, led by Isabel Rebollido of the Astrobiology Center in Spain, and now an ESA Research Fellow, used Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) to investigate the composition of Beta Pic’s previously detected main and secondary debris discs. The results exceeded their expectations, revealing a sharply inclined branch of dust, shaped like a cat’s tail, that extends from the southwest portion of the secondary debris disc.“Beta Pictoris is the debris disc that has it all: It has a really bright, close star that we can study very well,” said Isabel. “While there have been previous observations from the ground in this wavelength range, they did not have the sensitivity and the spatial resolution that we now have with Webb, so they didn’t detect this feature.” A star’s portrait improved with WebbIt was crucial that Webb peered at Beta Pic in the right wavelength range – in this case, the mid-infrared – to detect the cat’s tail, as it only appeared in the MIRI data. Webb’s mid-infrared data also revealed differences in temperature between Beta Pic’s two discs, which likely is due to differences in composition.“We didn’t expect Webb to reveal that there are two different types of material around Beta Pic, but MIRI clearly showed us that the material of the secondary disc and cat’s tail is hotter than the main disc,” said Christopher Stark, a co-author of the study at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “The dust that forms that disc and tail must be very dark, so we don’t easily see it at visible or near-infrared wavelengths – but in the mid-infrared, it’s glowing.”To explain the hotter temperature, the team deduced that the dust may be highly porous ''organic refractory material'', similar to the matter found on the surfaces of comets and asteroids in our Solar System. For example, a preliminary analysis of material sampled from asteroid Bennu by NASA’s OSIRIS-Rex mission found it to be very dark and carbon-rich, much like what MIRI detected at Beta Pic. The tail’s puzzling beginning warrants future research Star system Beta Pictoris (MIRI image, compass image) However, a major lingering question remains: what could explain the shape of the cat’s tail, a uniquely curved feature unlike what is seen in discs around other stars?Rebollido and the team modelled various scenarios in an attempt to emulate the cat’s tail and unravel its origins. Though further research and testing is required, the team presents a strong hypothesis that the cat’s tail is the result of a dust production event that occurred a mere one hundred years ago.“Something happens – like a collision – and a lot of dust is produced,” shared Marshall Perrin, a co-author of the study at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. “At first, the dust goes in the same orbital direction as its source, but then it also starts to spread out. The light from the star pushes the smallest, fluffiest dust particles away from the star faster, while the bigger grains do not move as much, creating a long tendril of dust.”“The cat’s tail feature is highly unusual, and reproducing the curvature with a dynamical model was difficult,” explained Christopher. “Our model requires dust that can be pushed out of the system extremely rapidly, which again suggests it’s made of organic refractory material.”The team’s preferred model explains the sharp angle of the tail away from the disc as a simple optical illusion. Our perspective combined with the curved shape of the tail creates the observed angle of the tail, while in fact, the arc of material is only departing from the disc at a five-degree incline. Taking into consideration the tail’s brightness, the team estimates the amount of dust within the cat’s tail to be equivalent to a large main belt asteroid spread out across 16 billion km.A recent dust production event within Beta Pic’s debris discs could also explain an asymmetry previously spotted by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in 2014: a clump of carbon monoxide located near the cat’s tail. Since the star’s radiation should break down carbon monoxide within roughly 100 years, this still-present concentration of gas could be lingering evidence of the same event.“Our research suggests that Beta Pic may be even more active and chaotic than we had previously thought,” said Christopher. “Webb continues to surprise us, even when looking at the most well-studied objects. We have a completely new window into these planetary systems.”These results were presented in a press conference at the 243rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society in New Orleans, Louisiana.The observations were taken as part of Guaranteed Time Observation program 1411.

The ''first light'' observations of this gas by JAXA’s X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) are now ready. They demonstrate that the mission will play a big role in unveiling the evolution of the Universe and the structure of spacetime. XRISM’s first test images show a cluster of galaxies and a supernova remnant – the husk left behind when a massive star explodes. What’s more, XRISM has measured the energy of incoming X-rays from the supernova remnant to reveal the chemical elements contained within it.The observations showcase the extraordinary capability of XRISM’s two science instruments. They were made during the mission’s ‘commissioning phase’ – when engineers carry out all the tests and checks needed to make sure the spacecraft is working as well as possible.X-ray images of the cosmos are special. They look very different to the images we are used to seeing in visible and infrared light, such as those from the James Webb and Hubble Space Telescopes. They also convey unique information about the Universe’s most dramatic phenomena, as X-rays are a very high-energy type of light emitted in the hottest and most violent events.XRISM is a collaboration between the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and NASA, with significant participation from ESA. In return for providing hardware and scientific advice, ESA is allocated 8% of XRISM’s available observing time.“It’s so exciting to see XRISM already carrying out such marvellous scientific observations, even though it is not yet fully calibrated,” says ESA Director of Science Carole Mundell. “It shows the potential this mission offers to our science communities for groundbreaking discoveries in the study of the most energetic phenomena in the Universe.”“I congratulate the engineering teams at JAXA, ESA and NASA for reaching this important milestone.” Galaxy cluster Abell 2319 Galaxy cluster Abell 2319 This pioneering image is a wide view of a nearby cluster of galaxies called Abell 2319. In purple we see X-ray light from million-degree gas that permeates between the galaxies in the cluster. Observing this gas helps astronomers measure the total mass of the galaxy cluster, revealing information about the birth and evolution of the Universe.XRISM’s observations of galaxy clusters will also provide insight into how the Universe produced and distributed the chemical elements that we find on Earth today. The hot gas found within clusters is a remnant of the birth and death of stars over billions of years. By studying the X-rays emitted by the gas, XRISM will discover which ‘metals’ (elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) it contains and map how the Universe became enriched with them.This image of Abell 2319 was taken with XRISM’s Xtend instrument, which uses a CCD camera to image extended X-ray emitting objects and their surroundings. Xtend’s unique ability to capture the entire cluster in a single shot promises a significant step forward in our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe.More information Supernova remnant N132D Spectrum of supernova remnant N132D This colourful shot shows the remains of a massive star exploding in the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud. The different colours indicate different energies of X-ray light, with red being lowest energy and blue being highest energy. Using its Resolve instrument, XRISM could complement the image of the supernova remnant taken by Xtend (top right) with a super-sharp view of the chemical elements that exist within N132D. This allows scientists to work out where exactly in the supernova remnant each element can be found.XRISM can identify each element by measuring the specific energy of X-ray light that it emits. The graph above shows separate spikes that were previously indistinguishable; this sets the stage for new insights into the formation and distribution of elements in the Universe, which form the basis of stars, planets and life itself.Resolve’s unique design also enables us to explore the temperatures, densities and motions of the hot X-ray emitting gas in this supernova remnant in more detail than ever before. This reveals how exactly the remnant interacts with its surroundings, as well as the nature of the explosion that created the remnant in the first place.More information What has JAXA been up to since launch? XRISM launched on 7 September. Since then, JAXA engineers and scientists have been working hard to get the telescope ready for science. This included switching on and testing out XRISM’s two instruments, Xtend and Resolve. X-ray mission lifts off to study high-energy Universe The spacecraft is currently in very good condition. Checks on onboard systems such as those that control the power supply, the orientation of the spacecraft, and the communication with Earth confirm that they work as planned. Hardware provided by ESA was tested early in the commissioning phase and is all working as expected.The Xtend instrument is working excellently. The Resolve instrument is also working very well. Its energy resolution – the key scientific performance indicator – is even exceeding requirements. However, engineers have not yet managed to open a filter covering the detector, designed to protect it before and during launch. Efforts are ongoing to fix the issue, but the XRISM team has decided that planned scientific observations should assume that the filter will remain in place. The N132D energy spectrum demonstrates that groundbreaking science can still be achieved. What’s next? The spacecraft commissioning phase will be finished by the end of January. In February, JAXA will start calibrating the instruments and demonstrating their capabilities. XRISM in a nutshell The observing time allocated to ESA, as part of a public observing programme open to scientists all over the world, will enable European scientists to seize the extraordinary scientific opportunities offered by the unprecedented high-resolution spectroscopic capabilities of Resolve. Scientists have already been invited to submit proposals for observations that they would like to make starting from August 2024. The deadline is 4 April 2024.“These first light images demonstrate that XRISM is fulfilling its promise of opening a new era in high-resolution imaging spectroscopy of hot gas in the Universe,” says ESA XRISM Project Scientist Matteo Guainazzi. “I warmly encourage scientists in ESA Member States to seize the unique opportunities offered by XRISM, by submitting proposals to observe using this magnificent telescope.”Observations made using XRISM will complement those from ESA’s XMM-Newton X-ray telescope, and will be an excellent foundation for observations planned with ESA’s future large-class mission NewAthena. The latter is being designed to significantly exceed the scientific performance of existing spectroscopic and survey X-ray observatories.

This provided them with a unique dataset that allowed them not only to analyse the atmosphere of WASP-121 b, but also to compare the state of the exoplanet’s atmosphere across several years. The team found clear evidence that the observations of WASP-121 b were varying in time. Using sophisticated modelling techniques, they demonstrated that these temporal variations could be explained by weather patterns in the exoplanet''s atmosphere. WASP-121 b (artist’s impression) Observing exoplanets – planets beyond our Solar System – is challenging, because of both their distance from Earth and the fact that they mostly orbit stars that are far bigger and brighter than the planets themselves. This means that astronomers who have been able to observe an exoplanet with a telescope as sophisticated as Hubble typically have to combine all their data in order to get enough information to make confident deductions about the exoplanet’s properties. By combining the observations to increase the strength of an exoplanet signal, astronomers can construct an averaged picture of its atmosphere, but this does not tell them whether it is changing. In other words, they cannot study the weather on other worlds using this averaging method. Studying weather requires far more data of high quality, taken over a longer period of time. Fortunately, Hubble has now been active for such an impressive length of time that a vast archive of Hubble data exists, sometimes with multiple sets of observations of the same celestial object – and that includes the exoplanet WASP-121 b.WASP-121 b (also known as Tylos) is a well-studied hot Jupiter [1] that orbits a star that lies about 880 light-years from Earth, completing a full orbit in a very brisk 30-hour period. Its extremely close proximity to its host star means that it is tidally locked [2], and that the star-facing hemisphere is very hot, with temperatures exceeding 3000 kelvin [3]. The team combined four sets of archival observations of WASP-121 b, all made using Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC 3). The complete assembled dataset included observations of: WASP-121 b transiting in front of its star (taken in June 2016); WASP-121 b transiting behind its star, also known as a secondary eclipse (taken in November 2016); and two phase-curves [4] of WASP-121 b (taken in March 2018 and February 2019 respectively). The team took the unique step of processing each dataset in the same way, even if it had been previously processed by a different team. Exoplanet data processing is time consuming and complicated, but nonetheless it was worth it because it allowed the team to directly compare the processed data from each set of observations with one another. Temperature forecast for WASP-121 b Access the video One of the principal investigators of the team, Quentin Changeat, an ESA Research Fellow at the Space Telescope Science Institute, elaborates:“Our dataset represents a significant amount of observing time for a single planet and is currently the only consistent set of such repeated observations. The information that we extracted from those observations was used to characterise (infer the chemistry, temperature, and clouds) of the atmosphere of WASP-121 b at different times. This provided us with an exquisite picture of the planet, changing in time.”After cleaning each dataset, the team found clear evidence that the observations of WASP-121 b were varying in time. While instrumental effects could remain, the data showed an apparent shift in the exoplanet’s hot spot [5] and differences in spectral signature (which signifies the chemical composition of the exoplanet’s atmosphere) indicative of a changing atmosphere. Next, the team used highly sophisticated computational models to attempt to understand observed behaviour of the exoplanet’s atmosphere. The models indicated that their results could be explained by quasi-periodic weather patterns, specifically massive cyclones that are repeatedly created and destroyed as a result of the huge temperature difference between the star-facing and dark side of the exoplanet. This result represents a significant step forward in potentially observing weather patterns on exoplanets.“The high resolution of our exoplanet atmosphere simulations allows us to accurately model the weather on ultra-hot planets like WASP-121 b,” explained Jack Skinner, a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology and co-leader of this study. “Here we make a significant step forward by combining observational constraints with atmosphere simulations to understand the time-varying weather on these planets.”“Weather on Earth is responsible for many aspects of our life, and in fact the long-term stability of Earth’s climate and its weather is likely the reason why life could emerge in the first place,” added Quentin. “Studying exoplanets’ weather is vital to understanding the complexity of exoplanet atmospheres, especially in our search for exoplanets with habitable conditions.”Future observations with Hubble and other powerful telescopes, including Webb, will provide greater insight into weather patterns on distant worlds: and ultimately, possibly to finding exoplanets with stable long-term climates and weather patterns. Cyclones on exoplanet WASP-121 b Access the video Notes [1] Hot Jupiters are a type of exoplanet with no direct Solar System analogue: they are inflated gas giants that orbit very close to their parent stars, often performing a complete orbit in a matter of a few days. [2] Tidal locking refers to the situation where an orbiting body always presents the same hemisphere to the object that it orbits. For example, the Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which explains why the surface of the Moon always looks the same from our perspective here on Earth. In some cases, the two bodies might be tidally locked to one another, although this is not the case for the Moon and Earth: from the perspective of an astronaut on the Moon, Earth still appears to rotate on its own axis. Tidally locked planets will have an extremely uneven temperature distribution across their entire surface, with the star-facing hemisphere much hotter than the other. [3] Kelvin (K) is the unit of temperature typically used by many scientists, including astronomers. One kelvin is the same as one degrees Celsius (°C, however, the kelvin scale is offset from the Celsius scale, which is set to zero at the freezing point of water at one atmosphere of pressure. In contrast, zero on the Kelvin scale is known as absolute zero, and is thought to be the lowest temperature possible, where all kinetic activity of all molecules ceases. 0 K is equivalent to –273.15 °C. [4] Exoplanet phase curves show the varying amount of light received from a star-exoplanet system as the exoplanet orbits its parent star. [5] Exoplanet hot spots are, as the name suggests, the hottest spots on an exoplanet’s surface. Whilst it would be intuitive to suppose that the hot spot will always be at the point on the planet closest to the star, in fact many studies have shown that exoplanet hot spots are frequently offset. This may be due to wind or other atmospheric patterns on the exoplanets themselves.

Equipped with a new generation of X-ray instruments with high sensitivity and a very wide view, this mission will survey the sky and hunt for powerful blasts of X-ray light coming from mysterious celestial objects such as neutron stars and black holes.Einstein Probe is a collaboration led by CAS with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE), Germany. In return for contributing to the development of this mission and the definition of its scientific goals, ESA will get access to 10% of the data generated by Einstein Probe’s observations.“Thanks to its innovative design, Einstein Probe can monitor large swaths of the sky at a glance. In this way we can discover many new sources while at the same time study the behaviour of X-ray light coming from known celestial objects over long periods,” says Erik Kuulkers, ESA’s Einstein Probe Project Scientist. “The cosmos is our only laboratory to investigate the most energetic processes. Missions like Einstein Probe are essential to advance our understanding of these processes and to learn more about fundamental aspects of high-energy physics.” Einstein Probe in a nutshell Keeping a watchful eye on the X-ray sky Unlike the stars that dot our sky at night and reliably mark the constellations, most cosmic objects that shine in X-rays are highly variable. They are continuously brightening and dimming, and in many cases, they briefly appear before they disappear for long periods (then they’re called transient) or for good.Powered by tumultuous cosmic events, X-ray light from astronomical sources is very unpredictable. Yet, it carries fundamental information about some of the most enigmatic objects and phenomena in our Universe. X-rays are associated with collisions between neutron stars, supernova explosions, matter falling onto black holes or hyper-dense stars, or high-energy particles being spewed out from discs of blazing material circling such exotic and mysterious objects.Einstein Probe will improve our understanding of these cosmic events by discovering new sources and monitoring the variability of objects shining in X-rays all over the sky.The capability of routinely spotting new X-ray sources is fundamental to advance our understanding of the origin of gravitational waves. When two hyper-dense massive objects such as two neutron stars or black holes crash, they create waves in the fabric of spacetime that travel over cosmic distances and reach us. Several detectors on Earth are now able to register this signal, but often cannot locate the source. If neutron stars are involved, such a ‘cosmic crash’ is accompanied by an enormous burst of energy across the light spectrum, and especially in X-rays. By enabling scientists to promptly study these short-lived events, Einstein Probe will help us identify the origin of many of the gravitational wave impulses that are being observed on Earth. Lobster eyes in space Assembling Einstein Probe To achieve all of its scientific goals, the Einstein Probe spacecraft is equipped with a new generation of instruments with high sensitivity and the ability to observe large areas of the sky: the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) and the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT).WXT has an optical modular design that mimics the eyes of a lobster and uses innovative Micro Pore Optics technology. This enables the instrument to observe 3600 square degrees (nearly one-tenth of the celestial sphere) in one shot. Thanks to this unique capability, Einstein Probe can keep a watchful eye on almost the entire night sky in three orbits around Earth (each orbit taking 96 minutes).New X-ray sources or other interesting events spotted by WXT are then targeted and studied in detail with the more sensitive FXT. Crucially, the spacecraft will also transmit an alert signal to the ground to trigger other telescopes on Earth and in space operating at other wavelengths (from radio to gamma-rays). They will swiftly point to the new source to collect precious multi-wavelength data, thus enabling a more thorough study of the event. European contribution Finishing touches to the Einstein Probe’s Follow-up Telescope ESA has played an important role in developing Einstein Probe’s scientific instrumentation. It provided support for testing and calibrating the X-ray detectors and the optics of WXT. ESA developed the mirror assembly of one of FXT’s two telescopes in collaboration with MPE and Media Lario (Italy).The FXT mirror assembly is based on the design and technology of the ESA’s XMM-Newton mission and the eROSITA X-ray telescope. MPE contributed the mirror assembly for the other telescope of FXT and developed the detector modules for both FXT’s units. ESA also provided the system to deflect unwanted electrons away from the detectors (the electron diverter).Throughout the mission, ESA’s ground stations will be used to help download the data from the spacecraft. ESA’s fleet of high-energy missions ESA has a long history of advancing high-energy astronomy. XMM-Newton and Integral have been scrutinising the Universe in X-rays and gamma-rays for over two decades leading to great progress in this field. ESA is also taking part in the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in collaboration with NASA, which launched in summer 2023.“Einstein Probe’s capabilities are highly complementary to the in-depth studies of individual cosmic sources enabled by the other missions,” remarks Erik. “This X-ray surveyor is also the ideal precursor to ESA’s NewAthena mission, currently under study and set to be the largest X-ray observatory ever built.” For more information, please contact: ESA Media RelationsEmail: media@esa.int Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

They visited NASA’s facilities at the Johnson Space Centre (JSC) in Houston, Texas, USA, to get familiar with the environment where they will spend a significant part of their training once assigned to a mission. The group included ESA astronaut candidates Sophie Adenot, Rosemary Coogan, Pablo Álvarez Fernández, Raphaël Liégeois, and Marco Sieber, ESA member of the reserve John McFall, alongside Katherine Bennell-Pegg from the Australian Space Agency. The candidates are currently undergoing basic astronaut training and familiarization primarily conducted at ESA’s European Astronaut Centre (EAC) in Cologne, Germany. The path to mission-readiness Alexander Gerst describes spacewalk training tools to ESA astronaut candidates Basic training provides aspiring ESA astronauts with an overall familiarization of their forthcoming tasks and responsibilities. It includes general knowledge on space programmes and space agencies, as well as an introduction to various technical and scientific disciplines. They also got an overview of all Space Station onboard systems and spacecraft which service the station, along with special skills training including robotics and scuba diving for spacewalk training under water. When they complete the one-year basic training programme, an ESA astronaut candidate becomes eligible for mission assignments, marking the transition to mission-specific training. This phase concentrates on tailored preparation for the assigned space-flight mission and involves more training time with partner agencies such as NASA. As underlined by Alexander Gerst, ESA astronaut and lead of astronaut operations at EAC guiding the visit, “this trip is an important milestone not only in their basic training, but in their astronaut careers. Now they are ready to widen their perspective to get introduced into ISS real time operations, and the international partnership framework that we have with NASA and see how people operate at JSC.” Exploring the Johnson Space Centre ESA astronaut candidates inside the Space Station mock-up at NASA''s Johnson Space Centre Their week-long stay at JSC offered an ideal opportunity for the group to familiarize with their upcoming training environments, meet their soon-to-be colleagues and counterparts as well as taking part in specialized training events. First stop for ESA’s astronaut candidates: an immersive experience exploring the Space Station architecture through a full-scale mock-up. “The moment I stepped into Building 9 and saw the full-scale mock-up was incredibly special. It was the first time I laid eyes on what could be my future home - a breath-taking marvel of human engineering that somehow felt surprisingly cosy”, says Marco. Following the overview, the astronaut candidates were briefed on emergency procedures and contingency communication related to the Space Station. They were also taking part in introductory exercises to familiarize them with specific habitability systems. “It was great having to learn more about some critical systems of the International Space Station and everything we will need in our everyday life later on, such as the astronauts’ planning tools, the storage systems and even the restrooms”, explains Raphaël. ESA astronaut candidates receiving a briefing session at NASA''s Johnson Space Center The visit also gave the candidates a first-hand experience at JSC’s control centre, showcasing real-time communication and operational procedures with the Space Station, guided by Capcom. Capcom directly communicates with astronauts aboard their spacecraft at NASA''s Mission Control Center in Houston.Meanwhile, EAC oversees communication through the European Communicator and Medical Operations (EUROCOM), linking ESA''s Columbus Control Centre, User Support and Operations Centres (USOCs) across Europe, and astronauts from diverse countries involved in ESA activities on the Space Station. “Seeing Mission Control in action was like witnessing a perfectly choreographed performance. The teamwork, quick decisions, and expertise were incredible. It made me realize how much I love challenges and exploring. It inspired me that I could be part of that coordinated effort in the heart of space missions one day”, says Pablo. Next on the programme was an all-time favourite of all future and experienced astronauts: spacewalk training. All the ESA astronaut candidates had previously received certification for diving in ESA''s Neutral Buoyancy Facility (NBF) at EAC as part of their basic training, preparing them for underwater spacewalk training aimed at simulating the weightless experience of space. During their time at NASA’s JSC, the astronaut candidates had the opportunity to explore the 12-meter-deep Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL). This facility hosts a replica of the entire Space Station, where astronauts can perform underwater simulations of spacewalks, or extravehicular activities (EVA), using the US spacesuit, known as the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). Observing a full space suit dive at NASA''s Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (NBL) As part of their visit, while scuba diving themselves, the group observed a full space suit dive, providing them with a more comprehensive understanding of the process and first-hand experience in the simulation. “I was very impressed to see all the modules of the Space Station replica underwater and the paths to follow during a spacewalk. Conducting an EVA training underwater requires a huge team of highly skilled personnel. I really enjoyed this dive: it helped me visualise what spacewalk training will consist of and I am really looking forward to come back to the NBL for the full EVA training flow!”, says Sophie. Meanwhile, John McFall, a member of the ESA astronaut reserve and subject matter expert involved in the Fly! Feasibility Study, also benefited from the trip by taking part in selected events dedicated to the study''s goals. The Fly! study focusses on understanding what it would take for people with physical disabilities to become professional astronauts and safely participate in meaningful space missions. ‘’Like many things in human space exploration, the Fly! Study requires international collaboration, and we’ve been delighted to have had such great support from NASA already. This visit is an opportunity to build on that relationship and further increase awareness of this unique project and the progressive and aspirational work we’re doing at ESA”, explains John. ESA astronauts and astronaut candidates at NASA''s Johnson Space Centre Beyond offering the first glimpse into a potential future training location and to round up the trip, the visit also served as a platform for our candidates to forge connections and interact with potential future colleagues from NASA, fostering professional relationships and knowledge exchange. “I found it really useful to get to know our future colleagues at NASA, who we’ll be working with closely during assigned training. It was great to meet and share experiences with those who are on a journey very similar to our own”, says Rosemary. Guiding the next generation ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano leading a tour for ESA astronaut candidates visiting NASA''s Johnson Space Centre For ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano, currently serving as liaison officer between EAC and JSC in Houston, organizing the visit turned out to be a resounding success. Being the European representative on-site and well-acquainted with all the people and facilities, Luca took pleasure in guiding them around while passing on his experience and knowledge to the next generation. “I think this was a very interesting time for all of us. I loved seeing the stars in their eyes when they entered the full-scale mock-up of the Space Station and then again during the dive inside NBL. It gave them a unique training opportunity and learning experience, complementing basic training, and providing them with a first real look and feel of future missions”, he says.

In this time, the mission has flipped our understanding of the Milky Way on its head, unveiling its shape and structure and revealing how mergers have affected the stars that call our galaxy home. In-depth Despite our many years spent observing the cosmos with ever-more powerful telescopes, there remains much to learn about the Milky Way. We cannot leave our galaxy to get a full outside view of its shape and properties, as we do when we study other galaxies. We are embedded within it, and so are limited to mapping the Milky Way from the inside out – and from a single vantage point.At the start of the millennium, it became clear that in order to understand our galaxy’s intricacies we needed precise, comprehensive data, and a dedicated, highly advanced space mission to gather them. Enter Gaia. Since it began surveying the skies in 2014, the satellite has compiled an unrivalled dataset on the positions, distances and motions of around 1.5 billion stars, enabling researchers to dig deep into our galaxy’s past and current structure.“Gaia’s discoveries represent a step change in how we understand the Milky Way. It’s astonishing what this mission has discovered in a relatively short space of time,” says Timo Prusti, Project Scientist for Gaia at ESA. “Gaia is uniquely designed to map the celestial objects around us. The mission is building a more detailed and complete view of the Milky Way, and this view is fundamentally changing what we thought we knew about our home galaxy.”This overview features just some of the key discoveries Gaia has made in the past decade. $(window).load(function() { $(".twentytwenty-container").twentytwenty({ default_offset_pct: 0.5, orientation: ''vertical'', before_label: "", after_label: "", set_container_height: true, move_slider_on_hover: false, move_with_handle_only: true, click_to_move: false });}); Top-down view of the Milky Way Open Image Weighing the Milky Way Determining the mass of the Milky Way is a tricky business. There are multiple complex parts of the galaxy and multiple sophisticated ways to ‘weigh’ them, resulting in significant uncertainty.The material in the Milky Way is spread out over a great area, extending far beyond the visible starry disc of the galaxy. This extended part of the Milky Way exists in the form of a so-called dark matter halo – a vast collection of material that appears to be dominated by invisible dark matter.This halo is being studied in depth by Gaia, to understand how much dark matter lies there and how it is distributed through space. Scientists are using Gaia to explore objects within this halo, far from the Milky Way’s disc, including streams of stars and debris, star clusters and dwarf galaxies. Dwarf galaxies contain a few thousand to a few billion stars at most and over 50 of them orbit the Milky Way as satellites, with more being discovered every year. Since these objects lie so far away, we need Gaia’s precise observations to pin down their positions and motions (astrometry). In some cases, Gaia data is supplemented by targeted observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. Gaia’s view of the Milky Way’s neighbouring galaxies These investigations have brought new insight about the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way, including one of the closest: the Large Magellanic Cloud. Gaia data has proven that this cloud is more massive than once thought, at about 10% of the mass of the Milky Way. Gaia has also shown how much this unexpectedly bulky galaxy influences the motions of objects further out in the Milky Way’s halo, skewing estimates of our galaxy’s mass that are derived by studying these satellite galaxies.Our picture of the Milky Way gets better and better as Gaia returns more data. There are still large uncertainties surrounding its total mass, with estimates ranging from a few hundred billion to a few trillion times the mass of the Sun. But as Gaia continues to explore our cosmic home and its components, we’ll more fully understand the complicated distant parts of our galaxy. Refining our galaxy’s shape Gaia has clarified the appearance of our galaxy, providing a more accurate view of its shape and symmetry – or lack of it.The Milky Way is a spiral galaxy with a central ‘bar’ of stars cutting through its core, multiple spiral arms, and a more diffuse halo extending outwards. This halo was assumed to be generally spherical and homogeneous, like a beach ball. However, Gaia has shown that the Milky Way’s halo instead looks elongated, tilted and stretched, like a rugby ball that has just been kicked.Gaia scientists have also mapped the general structure of the Milky Way’s central bar and swirling spiral arms, refining our understanding of their length, tilt and asymmetry.Additionally, we’ve known since the 1950s that the Milky Way’s disc is warped and asymmetrical, but we were unsure of why. Gaia has revealed that this warping is caused by an ongoing collision with another smaller galaxy – likely the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which has smashed through our galaxy’s disc three times in the past. Sagittarius has been orbiting our galaxy for 4–5 billion years, and is slowly being ripped apart in the course of an ongoing merger.These collisions have sent disruptive waves and ripples spreading through the Milky Way like a stone thrown into water, causing the galaxy to warp and wobble. They may have been the trigger that caused the Sun and Solar System to form: another result from Gaia. According to Gaia, the ripples caused by the influence of Sagittarius prompted multiple bursts of new star formation, one of which aligns in time with when we believe the Sun to have formed some 4.6 billion years ago.Gaia has shown that the Milky Way is still enduring some of the ripples caused by a near-miss collision with Sagittarius, which caused stars within the galaxy’s disc to move in distinct patterns. For some stars, Gaia measures not only their position in space but also their full movements in three dimensions. In these data, researchers have identified a never-before-seen pattern that looks a little like a snail’s shell. Further study led to the conclusion that the stars ‘remembered’ being perturbed by Sagittarius in the past, and still show signs of this in their ongoing motions. Sagittarius collisions trigger star formation in Milky Way Piecing together our family tree Sagittarius is not the only galaxy to have influenced the Milky Way. The early history of our galaxy is turbulent; it began forming over 13 billion years ago and has grown bigger and more massive by merging with other galaxies over time. As galaxies are subsumed into the Milky Way, their material forms streams of stars moving through space along distinct trajectories; each stream characterised by distinctly different chemistries.Gaia has revealed this ‘family tree’ of smaller galaxies that helped make the Milky Way what it is today. Crucially, Gaia discovered that the Milky Way merged with one galaxy, dubbed Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus, early in its formation – a major breakthrough in our understanding of galactic history. The 30 000 oddly moving stars that revealed this merger surround us almost completely; all move very differently to most of the other stars in the Milky Way, moving ‘in and out’ rather than ‘around''. The Milky Way and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus merged some 10 billion years ago, and this event has significantly shaped the form and evolution of our galaxy since.Gaia data also revealed another merger event, Arjuna/Sequoia/I’itoi, that likely happened at a similar stage to Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus. This event is thought to have filled the halo of the young Milky Way with globular clusters and ancient, high-velocity stars, all moving oddly and orbiting the ‘wrong’ way – in the direction opposite to the spiral’s spin. Arjuna/Sequoia/I’itoi and Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus may have been associated galaxies – perhaps a binary pair – before they merged with the Milky Way.A subsequent Gaia study defined six distinct star groups, representing six different mergers: the aforementioned Sagittarius, Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus and Arjuna/Sequoia/I’itoi mergers, Cetus, LMS-1/Wukong, and Pontus. Most are thought to have taken place between eight and ten billion years ago, with only Sagittarius being more recent. Another study using Gaia data explored a population of globular star clusters and found these to align well to a predicted seventh merger. This merger would have been perhaps the earliest to occur around 11 billion years ago, with a galaxy now referred to as ‘Kraken''. Gaia reveals a new member of the Milky Way family Additionally, Gaia has revealed that some parts of the Milky Way are far older than expected, and that there have been two key phases of galactic history. The first began under one billion years after the Big Bang, when stars began to form in a thick disc. Two billion years later a second phase of star formation was triggered here, as well as in the halo and thinner disc. This second phase is thought to have been sparked when the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus collided with the Milky Way.Gaia has also cast its eye over the smaller companion galaxies found in our patch of space today. These include the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and tens of other dwarf galaxies thought to be orbiting the Milky Way. However, Gaia studied 40 of these companions and found them to be moving much faster than the giant stars and star clusters known to be orbiting our galaxy; this means they may instead be visitors that only arrived in our vicinity in the last few billion years.Intriguing and surprising featuresThe Milky Way is filled with fascinating wavy structures made of gas, empty cavities in space, bursts of star formation, groups of star clusters whirling around the Milky Way’s core, odd neighbourhoods filled with ancient stars, and remnant signs of ‘fossilised’ spiral arms. All of these features, and others, have been detected and explored by Gaia.In 2020, Gaia spotted the largest gaseous structure ever seen in our galaxy: a long, thin, undulating ensemble of interconnected stellar nurseries located in the spiral arm close to Earth. While this wave has existed for many millions of years, scientists needed Gaia data on the Milky Way’s 3D structure to find it and reveal its shape.Gaia’s precise measurements of stars’ positions and motions have also revealed the shape and thickness of star-forming regions in three dimensions – the first time these so-called molecular clouds have been mapped in this way. The Local Bubble around the Sun Further mapping uncovered the origin and impact of the Local Bubble, a relatively empty, peanut-shaped patch of space that the Sun traverses on its orbit through the Milky Way. We have known of the Local Bubble’s existence for some time, but Gaia has uncovered more. Gaia scientists found that a number of exploding stars pushed gas outwards to create this bubble, also triggering the formation of all the young stars we see in our galactic neighbourhood.Looking further out in the Milky Way, scientists used Gaia data to map structures in our galaxy’s outer disc, revealing a huge number of spinning filaments. The scientists suggest that these filaments are actually the remnants of past spiral arms. These structures became excited over time as different satellite galaxies whirled past and interacted with our galaxy, causing them to spin.Alongside structure, Gaia is keeping a close eye on stars. The mission has found thousands of new star clusters, many more than we knew of previously, thanks to scientists applying new machine learning techniques to Gaia data. In one key finding, astronomers used Gaia data to carry out ‘galactic archaeology’ and discover that the Milky Way’s core is full of stars that are truly ancient: so ancient that they lack the heavier metals created later in the Universe’s lifetime. Researchers identified these stars by exploring two million bright giant stars in our galaxy’s inner regions, mapping the Milky Way’s ‘poor old heart’. Interactive map of the sky from Gaia’s Early Data Release 3 The tip of the iceberg These findings are just some of the ground-breaking results from Gaia. They, and others, have resulted in a renewed, clearer and more detailed view of the Milky Way’s structure, contents and history, giving us a far more complete understanding of our galaxy.“As well as refining and demystifying some of the things we already knew, Gaia has questioned and ultimately rejected a number of assumptions we had about the Milky Way,” says Paul McMillan of University of Leicester. “It’s no exaggeration to say that Gaia is rewriting cosmic history.”Gaia releases data in batches. The first, second, early-third and third of these came in 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022 respectively, with a subsequent ‘focused product release’ earlier this year. This article focuses on discoveries made since Gaia’s early Data Release 3 in 2020 and reflects just a selection of the research coming from the mission. For more findings, see ESA’s Gaia page.

What Webb found is a dynamic world with rings, moons, storms and other atmospheric features – including a seasonal polar cap. The image expands upon a two-colour version released earlier this year, adding additional wavelength coverage for a more detailed look. With its exquisite sensitivity, Webb captured Uranus’s dim inner and outer rings, including the elusive Zeta ring – the extremely faint and diffuse ring closest to the planet. It also imaged many of the planet’s 27 known moons, even seeing some small moons within the rings.In visible wavelengths, Uranus appeared as a placid, solid blue ball. In infrared wavelengths (as seen in this article), Webb is revealing a strange and dynamic ice world filled with exciting atmospheric features.One of the most striking of these is the planet’s seasonal north polar cap. Compared to the image from earlier this year, some details of the cap are easier to see in these newer images. These include the bright, white, inner cap and the dark lane in the bottom of the polar cap, toward the lower latitudes.Several bright storms can also be seen near and below the southern border of the polar cap. The number of these storms, and how frequently and where they appear in Uranus’s atmosphere, might be due to a combination of seasonal and meteorological effects.The polar cap becomes prominent when the planet’s pole begins to point towards the Sun, as it approaches solstice and receives more sunlight. Uranus reaches its next solstice in 2028, and astronomers are eager to watch any possible changes in the structure of these features. Webb will help disentangle the seasonal and meteorological effects that influence Uranus’s storms, which is critical to help astronomers understand the planet’s complex atmosphere. Uranus close-up view (NIRCam) Because Uranus orbits on its side at a tilt of about 98 degrees, it has the most extreme seasons in the Solar System. For nearly a quarter of each Uranian year, the Sun shines over one pole, plunging the other half of the planet into a dark, 21-year-long winter.With Webb’s unparalleled infrared resolution and sensitivity, astronomers now see Uranus and its unique features with groundbreaking clarity. These details, especially of the close-in Zeta ring, will be invaluable to planning any future missions to Uranus, particularly the proposed Uranus orbiter and probe.Scientists want to bring any visiting spacecraft as close to the planet as possible to measure the gravitational field of Uranus and better analyse the atmosphere. However, such a close approach would need to be planned carefully to avoid collisions with any possible debris from icy and dusty rings.Uranus can also serve as a proxy for studying the many far-off, similarly sized exoplanets that have been discovered in the last few decades. This ''exoplanet in our backyard'' can help astronomers understand how planets of this size work, what their meteorology is like, and how they formed. This can in turn help us understand our own Solar System as a whole by placing it in a larger context.

In this first phase, selected companies will be asked to carry out all activities necessary to enabling a first flight demonstration to the International Space Station by 2028; this should be part of the ESA Director General’s proposal at the next ESA council at ministerial level in 2025, where representatives of the Agency''s Member States make decisions on the entirety of ESA’s programmes. ISS seen from Space Shuttle Atlantis following undocking Today, Europe relies on its international partners to bring its cargo and crew to space via a bartering system. In the past, ESA provided the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), which has delivered over 30 000 kg of cargo to the International Space Station between 2008 and 2015; this, as well as other contributions including Columbus, the European laboratory on the Station, enabled European astronauts to fly regularly to low-Earth orbit. The ATV''s design is the basis for the European Service Module (ESM), which propels the crewed Orion spacecraft during NASA''s Artemis missions; the multiple ESMs required for the Artemis missions, as well as significant contributions to the Gateway will support the acquisition of current and future European astronaut flights and more. ATV-2 docking with ISS on 24 February 2011 However, the space exploration landscape is changing, with increasing commercialisation in low-Earth orbit. In the next decade we expect the development of privately-owned space stations, rather than institutionally-owned such as the International Space Station. Without a meaningful element for bartering, ESA would have to buy a ticket to space in cash to continue our presence in low-Earth orbit, rather than developing industrial expertise in Europe to do so. European Service Module, Orion, Moon, Earth With this new initiative, European industry will develop a way to bring cargo to and from space stations in low-Earth orbit before the end of this decade, providing Europe with access to space, further bartering prospects, and the opportunity for European industry to develop commercial services for cargo transportation to low-Earth orbit on the global market. This cargo service could also become a stepping stone to develop one day a crew transportation to low-Earth orbit and possibly a cargo return capability from the Gateway. This opportunity is a first step in ESA’s renewed ambitious space exploration programme supporting Europe''s continued journey to low-Earth orbit and beyond to the Moon and Mars.

The smallest brown dwarfs can overlap in mass with giant planets. In a quest to find the smallest brown dwarf, astronomers using the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope have found the new record-holder: an object weighing just three to four times the mass of Jupiter. Brown dwarfs are objects that straddle the dividing line between stars and planets. They form like stars, growing dense enough to collapse under their own gravity, but they never become dense and hot enough to begin fusing hydrogen and turn into a star. At the low end of the scale, some brown dwarfs are comparable with giant planets, weighing just a few times the mass of Jupiter.Astronomers are trying to determine the smallest object that can form in a star-like manner. An international team using the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope has identified the new record-holder: a tiny, free-floating brown dwarf with only three to four times the mass of Jupiter.“One basic question you’ll find in every astronomy textbook is, what are the smallest stars? That’s what we’re trying to answer,” explained lead author Kevin Luhman of Pennsylvania State University.To locate this newfound brown dwarf, Luhman and his colleague, Catarina Alves de Oliveira, chose to study the star cluster IC 348, located about 1000 light-years away in the Perseus star-forming region. This cluster is young, only about five million years old. As a result, any brown dwarfs would still be relatively bright in infrared light, glowing from the heat of their formation.The team first imaged the centre of the cluster using Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) to identify brown dwarf candidates from their brightness and colours. They followed up on the most promising targets using Webb’s NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) microshutter array. Star Cluster IC 348 (NIRCam image annotated) Webb’s infrared sensitivity was crucial, allowing the team to detect fainter objects than ground-based telescopes. In addition, Webb’s sharp vision enabled them to determine which red objects were pinpoint brown dwarfs and which were blobby background galaxies.This winnowing process led to three intriguing targets weighing three to eight Jupiter masses, with surface temperatures ranging from 830 to 1500 degrees Celsius. The smallest of these weighs just three to four times Jupiter, according to computer models.Explaining how such a small brown dwarf could form is theoretically challenging. A heavy and dense cloud of gas has plenty of gravity to collapse and form a star. However, because of its weaker gravity, it should be more difficult for a small cloud to collapse to form a brown dwarf, and that is especially true for brown dwarfs with the masses of giant planets.“It’s pretty easy for current models to make giant planets in a disc around a star,” said Catarina Alves de Oliveira of ESA, principal investigator on the observing program. “But in this cluster, it would be unlikely that this object formed in a disc, instead forming like a star, and three Jupiter masses is 300 times smaller than our Sun. So we have to ask, how does the star formation process operate at such very, very small masses?”In addition to providing clues about the star formation process, tiny brown dwarfs also can help astronomers better understand exoplanets. The least massive brown dwarfs overlap with the largest exoplanets; therefore, they would be expected to have some similar properties. However, a free-floating brown dwarf is easier to study than a giant exoplanet since the latter is hidden within the glare of its host star.Two of the brown dwarfs identified in this survey show the spectral signature of an unidentified hydrocarbon, a molecule containing both hydrogen and carbon atoms. The same infrared signature was detected by NASA’s Cassini mission in the atmospheres of Saturn and its moon Titan. It has also been seen in the interstellar medium, the gas between stars.“This is the first time we’ve detected this molecule in the atmosphere of an object outside our Solar System,” explained Catarina. “Models for brown dwarf atmospheres don’t predict its existence. We’re looking at objects with younger ages and lower masses than we ever have before, and we’re seeing something new and unexpected.”Since the objects are well within the mass range of giant planets, it raises the question of whether they are indeed brown dwarfs, or in fact rogue planets that were ejected from planetary systems. While the team can’t rule out the latter, they argue that they are far more likely to be brown dwarfs than an ejected planets. Star Cluster IC 348 (NIRCam compass image) An ejected giant planet is unlikely for two reasons. First, such planets are uncommon in general compared to planets with smaller masses. Second, most stars are low-mass stars, and giant planets are especially rare among those stars. As a result, it’s unlikely that most of the stars in IC 348 (which are low-mass stars) are capable of producing such massive planets. In addition, since the cluster is only five million years old, there probably hasn’t been enough time for giant planets to form and then be ejected from their systems.The discovery of more such objects will help clarify their status. Theories suggest that rogue planets are more likely to be found in the outskirts of a star cluster, so expanding the search area may identify them if they exist within IC 348.Future work may also include longer surveys that can detect fainter, smaller objects. The short survey conducted by the team was expected to detect objects as small as twice the mass of Jupiter. Longer surveys could easily reach one Jupiter mass.These observations were taken as part of Guaranteed Time Observation program #1229. The results were published in the Astronomical Journal.

ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen is helping to understand how to do it efficiently and at larger scales by testing water filtration membranes on the International Space Station as part of his Huginn mission. Mimicking nature’s work The membrane in Aquamembrane-3 with the membrane on top in light blue and a support structure beneath. Built into a suitcase-sized container, the Aquamembrane experiment consists of several pumps that draw out water from three wastewater bags on the Space Station through a membrane. The membrane will filter out contaminants and leave behind the clean water. Pumps then transport the clean water from the membrane to three water bags, that will be sent down to Earth to test the purity of the water.The membrane, called Aquaporin Hollow Fiber Forward Osmosis or HFFO in short, is made by small proteins, called aquaporins, that exist in nature, for example in plants and in kidneys. The proteins allow only water to pass through the membrane, while keeping ions and salts out, mimicking the natural way of filtering water in the human bodyThe membrane excels on energy efficiency using only half a dozen 9V batteries, like the ones in fire alarms, to drive the water past the membrane, which makes it ideal for both space, especially future missions to the Moon and beyond, and other areas where clean water and energy is not available. The proteins making up the Aquamembrane-3, aquaporins, moving water molecules through the membrane while keeping other particles and ions out. Water blast from the past Aquamembrane-1 during the iriss mission An earlier version of Aquamembrane was also tested by Andreas during his iriss mission in 2015. Back then, instead of active pumps driving the unclean water past the membrane, Andreas used syringes. While the old version showed that the membrane did function in microgravity, this new version will try to quantify the efficiency of the membrane microgravity. It is also simpler to run with only a power connector and an on/off switch to turn on the pumps.“This new experiment during Andreas’s Huginn mission allows us to get real data on efficiency of the membrane and water quality, which is essential for our work on a full prototype. Results will allow us to identify the right size for the membranes, flow speed and many other parameters required for a fully operational prototype. We are very much looking forward to these data,” says Thomas A. E. Andersen, CEO of Danish Aerospace Company. Besides testing the Aquamembrane for space exploration, Aquaporin also works on projects for using the membranes on Earth, providing clean drinking water in the EU project REWAISE together with Spanish company Aqualia.

However, this scene is no proverbial silent night – all is not calm. Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) view of Cas A displays a very violent explosion at a resolution previously unreachable at these wavelengths. This high-resolution look unveils intricate details of the expanding shell of material slamming into the gas shed by the star before it exploded.Cas A is one of the best-studied supernova remnants in all the cosmos. Over the years, ground-based and space-based observatories, including the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, have collectively assembled a multiwavelength picture of the object’s tattered remains.However, astronomers have now entered a new era in the study of Cas A. In April 2023, Webb’s MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) started this story, revealing new and unexpected features within the inner shell of the supernova remnant. But many of those features are invisible in the new NIRCam image, and astronomers are investigating why that is.Infrared light is invisible to our eyes, so image processors and scientists represent these wavelengths of light with visible colours. In this newest image of Cas A, colours were assigned to NIRCam’s different filters, and each of those colours hints at different activity occurring within the object.At first glance, the NIRCam image may appear less colourful than the MIRI image. However, this does not mean there is less information: it simply comes down to the wavelengths in which the material in the object is emitting its light. $(window).load(function() { $(".twentytwenty-container").twentytwenty({ default_offset_pct: 0.5, orientation: ''horizontal'', before_label: "", after_label: "", set_container_height: true, move_slider_on_hover: false, move_with_handle_only: true, click_to_move: false });}); Cas A (NIRCam and MIRI comparison) Open Image The most noticeable colours in Webb’s newest image are clumps of bright orange and light pink that make up the inner shell of the supernova remnant. Webb’s razor-sharp view can detect the tiniest knots of gas, composed of sulphur, oxygen, argon, and neon from the star itself. Embedded in this gas is a mixture of dust and molecules, which will eventually be incorporated into new stars and planetary systems. Some filaments of debris are too tiny to be resolved, even by Webb, meaning that they are comparable to or less than 16 billion km across (around 100 astronomical units). In comparison, the entirety of Cas A spans 10 light-years, or roughly 96 trillion km.When comparing Webb’s new near-infrared view of Cas A with the mid-infrared view, its inner cavity and outermost shell are curiously devoid of colour. The outskirts of the main inner shell, which appeared as a deep orange and red in the MIRI image, now look like smoke from a campfire. This marks where the supernova blast wave is ramming into the surrounding circumstellar material. The dust in the circumstellar material is too cool to be detected directly at near-infrared wavelengths, but lights up in the mid-infrared.Researchers have concluded that the white colour is light from synchrotron radiation, which is emitted across the electromagnetic spectrum, including the near-infrared. It’s generated by charged particles travelling at extremely high speeds and spiralling around magnetic field lines. Synchrotron radiation is also visible in the bubble-like shells in the lower half of the inner cavity.Also not seen in the near-infrared view is the loop of green light in the central cavity of Cas A that glowed in mid-infrared light, appropriately nicknamed the Green Monster by the research team. This feature was described as ‘challenging to understand’ by researchers at the time of their first look.While the ‘green’ of the Green Monster is not visible in NIRCam, what’s left over in the near-infrared in that region can provide insight into the mysterious feature. The circular holes visible in the MIRI image are faintly outlined in white and purple emission in the NIRCam image – this represents ionised gas. Researchers believe this is due to the supernova debris pushing through and sculpting gas left behind by the star before it exploded.Researchers were also absolutely stunned by one fascinating feature at the bottom right corner of NIRCam’s field of view. They’re calling that large, striated blob Baby Cas A – because it appears like an offspring of the main supernova.This is a light echo. Light from the star’s long-ago explosion has reached, and is warming, distant dust, which glows as it cools down. The intricacy of the dust pattern, and Baby Cas A’s apparent proximity to Cas A itself, are particularly intriguing to researchers. In actuality, Baby Cas A is located about 170 light-years behind the supernova remnant.There are also several other, smaller light echoes scattered throughout Webb’s new portrait.The Cas A supernova remnant is located 11 000 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia. It’s estimated to have exploded about 340 years ago from our point of view. More informationWebb is the largest, most powerful telescope ever launched into space.

In-depth Ariel mission patch Today, the preliminary spacecraft design of ESA’s future exoplanet mission Ariel got approval from the ESA review board and passed the Preliminary Design Review with flying colours.This concludes the important preliminary design phase B2 of the mission that lasted 19 months. During this phase, the design of the spacecraft has been refined, including the requirements for the interfaces, in particular with the payload elements. Ariel’s development plans have also been finalised.Ariel’s scientific payload, comprising a cryogenic telescope hosting two instruments, Ariel medium-resolution InfraRed Spectrometer (AIRS) and Fine Guidance System (FGS), a cryocooler and several electronic boxes, already passed this crucial review in May 2023. Ariel’s prime contractor Airbus Defence and Space Toulouse can now begin manufacturing the first spacecraft prototypes: the structural model (SM) and the avionics verification model (AVM).“We are delighted that we have achieved a significant milestone in spacecraft design, marking a solid foundation to proceed with detailed development across all subsystems and with the manufacturing phase,” says Jean-Christophe Salvignol, Ariel’s project manager. “The prospect of witnessing the hardware is truly exciting! I''m especially enthusiastic about the manufacturing and assembly of the structural model, as its structure will closely resemble the final product set to take flight.”Ariel’s structural model will be subjected to tough environmental test conditions to verify that the spacecraft''s subsystems can cope with the conditions expected during launch and in space. The avionics verification model will serve to demonstrate the functionality and the performance of the electronic and software systems used in the spacecraft, including control, communication, navigation, and data processing systems. When these two models work properly, the mission will go through the Critical Design Review and the actual flight model (the one that will go into space) will be built. Transmission spectroscopy “It is fantastic to see the important spacecraft design review successful. Having passed this milestone , we can continue the implementation of this exciting mission that will revolutionise our knowledge of how planets around other stars form and evolve and what their atmospheres are made of,” adds Theresa Lueftinger, Ariel’s project scientist. “Particularly exciting is the ‘coming into existence’ of the hardware: we will soon be able to see and test the Ariel structural model, which is always a very special moment for any scientist working on a space mission.”During its mission Ariel will observe up to 1000 exoplanets, ranging from rocky planets like Earth to gas giants like Jupiter. Using its scientific instruments, Ariel will detect signs of well-known ingredients in the planets’ atmospheres, including water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane. For a few planets, Ariel will even study their weather, monitoring clouds and variations in their atmospheres on both daily and seasonal timescales. About Ariel Ariel was selected as the fourth medium (‘M-class’) mission in ESA''s Cosmic Vision 2015–25 plan in March 2018. It was adopted in November 2020 and is currently under development.Ariel is a collaboration between ESA and the Ariel Mission Consortium. Involving more than 50 institutes from 16 European countries, the Consortium will provide the payload elements, including the large cryogenic telescope and associated science instruments. NASA and CSA are also partners of the Ariel mission by contributing to the Ariel payload.Meanwhile, Airbus is leading the European industrial consortium that is building the spacecraft. They will provide the service module and will be in charge of integrating and testing the overall flight spacecraft, as well as the SM and AVM development models.ESA has the overarching responsibility for the development of the mission, as well as being responsible for the launch and operations. After launch, operations will be conducted jointly by ESA and the Consortium.Read more about Ariel here Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Taken with expert timing Red sprite over thundercloud Every Saturday Andreas grabbed the Space Station’s camera, mounted the Davis camera on top and headed to the Cupola to look out for thunderstorms on Earth. The first image is now out.Andreas managed to capture a red sprite, a thunderous phenomenon called Transient Luminous Event (TLE), that takes place above thunderclouds, between 40 and 80 kilometres over the ground. From the image and the video, he captured, scientists estimate that the size of the red sprite is roughly 14 by 26 km. As the red sprites form above thunder clouds, they are not easily studied from ground and are therefore mostly seen from space, including using the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) that sits on the outside of the Space Station. However few sprites have been seen from the ground. That shot was fast as lightning Davis camera view of a red sprite The Davis camera is an event camera, which works more like the human eye, sensing change in contrast instead of capturing an image like a regular camera. The power draw of an event camera is very low, on the order of a few watts while still being able to take the equivalent of 100 000 pictures a second. The speed of the camera is evident from the video below where you see the thunder strike below and then the red sprite form above.“These images taken by Andreas are fantastic. The Davis camera works well and gives us the high temporal resolution necessary to capture the quick processes in the lightning,” said Olivier Chanrion, lead scientist for this experiment and DTU Space senior researcher. Standing on the shoulders of Thor Storm hunter infographics The Thor-Davis experiment investigates lightning in the upper atmosphere and how it might affect the concentration of greenhouse gasses. It builds upon the former Thor experiment from Andreas’s first mission in 2015, when he also captured images of a different thunder event shooting up towards space, a blue jet,.

These results suggest that the conditions for rocky-planet formation, typically found in discs in regions where low-mass stars are formed, can also occur in regions where massive stars are formed and possibly in a broader range of environments. These are the first results from the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) James Webb Space Telescope programme that focuses on the characterisation of planet-forming discs in regions where massive stars are formed. These regions are likely representative of the environment in which most planetary systems formed. Understanding the impact of the environment on planet formation is important for scientists to gain insights into the diversity of the observed exoplanet populations.The XUE programme targets a total of 15 discs in three areas of the Lobster Nebula (also known as NGC 6357), a large emission nebula roughly 5500 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Scorpius. The Lobster Nebula is one of the youngest and closest star formation regions hosting some of the most massive stars in our galaxy. Massive stars are hotter, and therefore emit more ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This can disperse the gas in the disc, making their expected lifetime as short as a million years. Thanks to Webb, astronomers can now study the effect of UV radiation on the inner rocky-planet-forming regions of protoplanetary discs around stars like our Sun. Artist’s impression of protoplanetary disc “Webb is the only telescope with the spatial resolution and sensitivity to study planet-forming discs in regions where massive stars are formed,” said team lead María Claudia Ramírez-Tannus of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany.Astronomers aim to characterise the physical properties and chemical composition of the rocky-planet-forming regions of discs in the Lobster Nebula using Webb’s Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). This first result focuses on the protoplanetary disc termed XUE 1, which is located in the star cluster Pismis 24. Protoplanetary disc XUE 1 (MIRI emission spectrum: 13.3–15.5 microns) “Only the MIRI wavelength range and spectral resolution allow us to probe the molecular inventory and physical conditions of the warm gas and dust where rocky planets form,” said team member Arjan Bik of Stockholm University in Sweden.Because of its location near several massive stars in NGC6357, scientists expect XUE 1 to have been constantly exposed to a high ultraviolet radiation field throughout its life. However, in this extreme environment the team still detected a range of molecules that are the building blocks of rocky planets.“We find that the inner disc around XUE 1 is remarkably similar to those in nearby star-forming regions,” said team member Rens Waters of Radboud University in the Netherlands. “We’ve detected water and other molecules like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide and acetylene. However, the emission found was weaker than some models predicted. This might imply a small outer disc radius.”“We were surprised and excited because this is the first time that these molecules have been detected under such extreme conditions,” added Lars Cuijpers of Radboud University. The team also found evidence of small, partially crystalline silicate dust grains at the disc’s surface. These are considered to be the building blocks of rocky planets. Protoplanetary disc XUE 1 (MIRI emission spectrum: 4.95–5.15 microns) These results are good news for rocky planet formation, as the science team finds that the conditions in the inner disc resemble those found in the well-studied discs located in nearby star-forming regions, where only low-mass stars form. This suggests that rocky planets can form in a much broader range of environments than previously believed.The team notes that the remaining observations from the XUE programme are crucial to establishing the commonality of these conditions.“XUE1 shows us that the conditions to form rocky planets are there, so the next step is to check how common that is,” says Ramírez-Tannus. “We will observe other discs in the same region to determine the frequency with which these conditions can be observed.”These results have been published in The Astrophysical Journal.

The discovery is particularly valuable because the planets’ orbital configuration shows that the system is largely unchanged since its formation more than a billion years ago. In-depth ESA’s CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (Cheops) has provided the crucial pieces of data to understand a mysterious exoplanet system that had been perplexing researchers for years.The star HD110067 lies around 100 light-years away in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices. In 2020, NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) detected dips in the star’s brightness that indicated planets were passing in front of the star’s surface. A preliminary analysis revealed two possible planets. One with an orbital period – the time it takes to complete one orbit around the star – of 5.642 days, and the other with a period that could not be determined yet. Two years later, TESS observed the same star again. Analysing the combined data sets ruled out the original interpretation but presented two different possible planets. While these detections were much more certain than the originals, there was a lot about the TESS data that still did not make sense. That was when Rafael Luque of the University of Chicago and his colleagues became interested.“That’s when we decided to use Cheops. We went fishing for signals among all the potential periods that those planets could have,” says Rafael. Their efforts paid off. They confirmed a third planet in the system and realised that they had found the key to unlocking the whole system because it was now clear that the three planets were in an orbital resonance. The outer-most planet takes 20.519 days to orbit, which is extremely close to 1.5 times the orbital period of the next planet with 13.673 days. This in turn is almost exactly 1.5 times the orbital period of the inner planet, with 9.114 days. Infographic explaining the HD110067 system Predicting other orbital resonances and matching them to the remaining unexplained data allowed the team to discover the other three planets in the system. “Cheops gave us this resonant configuration that allowed us to predict all the other periods. Without that detection from Cheops, it would have been impossible,” explains Rafael.Orbitally resonant systems are extremely important to find because they tell astronomers about the formation and subsequent evolution of the planetary system. Planets around stars tend to form in resonance but can be easily perturbed. For example, a very massive planet, a close encounter with a passing star, or a giant impact event can all disrupt the careful balance. As a result, many of the multi-planet system known to astronomers are not in resonance but look close enough that they could have been resonant once. However, multi-planet systems preserving their resonance are rare. Orbital geometry of HD110067 “We think only about one percent of all systems stay in resonance,” says Rafael. That’s why HD110067 is special and invites further study. “It shows us the pristine configuration of a planetary system that has survived untouched.”“As our science team puts it: Cheops is making outstanding discoveries sound ordinary. Out of only three known six-planet resonant systems, this is now the second one found by Cheops, and in only three years of operations,” says Maximilian Günther, ESA project scientist for Cheops. HD110067 is the brightest known system with four or more planets. Since those planets are all sub-Neptune-sized with atmospheres that are likely extended, it makes them ideal candidates for studying the composition of their atmospheres using the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope and the ESA’s future Ariel and Plato telescopes.

Even though there is no wind to slow down astronauts when pedaling on the Space Station, keeping motivation to bike faster or longer while living for six months in a confined space can be difficult.This is what the Virtual Reality for Exercise experiment sets out to explore. ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen will wear a virtual reality headset while using the Space Station’s exercise bike. Up and down the virtual roads FERGO bike installed on the International Space Station Andreas will watch a series of videos that will take him on different bike paths. The bike will adapt to the inclination in the video, adjusting to the difficulty Andreas would expect climbing or descending the slope he sees. Three videos have been recorded on Danish bike paths, with more to come as the developer, Danish Aerospace Company, invited Danes to record their favourite bike path and have a lucky winner have their bike path uploaded to Andreas’ virtual reality headset.The experiment will give the developers a look into how immersive virtual reality could motivate an astronaut during their daily exercise routine on the Space Station. The astronauts need to exercise two hours of exercise each day to counteract the effects of microgravity on their muscles and bones. The videos provide a change in scenery from the interior of their home in space – not all exercise stations have a window. New bike day Andreas Mogensen exercising on the old CEVIS bike during his iriss mission in 2015 A new Space Station exercise bike called Flight Ergometer, or Fergo for short, arrived in August 2023 and will replace the current CEVIS bike, which has been in orbit since 2007. Fergo is lighter, smaller, and just looks faster. Besides looking more aerodynamic, the new bike can handle an astronaut putting out 500 watts during exercise – a substantial improvement compared to the CEVIS’s 350 watts.Fergo comes with a computer with 21st-century features such as wireless connectivity, and compatibility with the virtual reality headset. Getting virtual reality to work in space Virtual reality headsets use gravity to know where the viewer is looking, relying on the fact that on Earth gravity always pulls down. With that point of reference, a headset can orient videos as the user’s head looks around in their virtual reality. On the Space Station, where the astronauts live in weightlessness, a normal virtual reality headset loses its orientation.

Three icy moons. An eight-year journey. One special spacecraft.Building a mission to Jupiter took years of planning and thousands of people. Now that Juice is finally en route to its destination, our documentary ‘The making of Juice’ takes a look behind the scenes at the development and testing of the spacecraft in the three years leading up to launch. We hear from Juice Project Manager, Giuseppe Sarri, about how and why the film was made. During autumn 2019, Olivier Witasse (Juice Project Scientist) and I were discussing the long-term plan for Juice outreach and we came up with the idea of filming key moments in the final stages of the development and testing of Juice. That year in March we’d had the ‘Critical Design Review’, which gave the green light to integrate and test the Juice spacecraft. It seemed just the right moment to start recording our progress, with the idea to capture not only the technical aspects but, above all, the human elements of this very challenging endeavour.Olivier knew Maarten Roos who, besides being a well-known maker of space science movies, is a planetary scientist with a deep understanding of Jupiter. Olivier met Maarten in October 2019 to brainstorm over a coffee at Leiden Centraal train station. A first draft of the concept was proposed and discussed all together in December, and the activity kicked off in January 2020. After the first interviews with Olivier and myself in late February 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the project hard, as you can see from many interviewees wearing masks. But we managed!Maarten was collecting so much special content, and we did not want to wait the launch of Juice to show it publicly. So he came up with the idea of regularly (every two to three months) releasing self-standing movies, each about five minutes long, to keep the public updated on the development of the spacecraft. With little imagination we called them ‘episodes’ and we released 12 of them. We also released 17 one-minute videos, which we called ‘snippets of action’.After the launch of Juice, on 14 April 2023, Maarten combined everything together into one full-length documentary, and here we are: ‘The Making of Juice’ is ready for release. It includes stunning images of the integration and launch of the spacecraft; interviews with engineers, technicians, scientists and managers; and animations explaining the mission and its scientific objectives. It is an entertaining movie, easy to watch, telling the story of Juice from initial conception to the start of its voyage to Jupiter. And it shows that behind all great projects are great people.

The star-forming region, named Sagittarius C (Sgr C), is about 300 light-years from the Milky Way’s central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*. Amid the estimated 500 000 stars in the image is a cluster of protostars – stars that are still forming and gaining mass – producing outflows that glow like a bonfire in the midst of an infrared-dark cloud. At the heart of this young cluster is a previously known, massive protostar over 30 times the mass of our Sun. The cloud the protostars are emerging from is so dense that the light from stars behind it cannot reach Webb, making it appear less crowded when in fact it is one of the most densely packed areas of the image. Smaller infrared-dark clouds dot the image, looking like holes in the starfield. That’s where future stars are forming. Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) instrument also captured large-scale emission from ionised hydrogen surrounding the lower side of the dark cloud, shown cyan-coloured in the image. Typically, this is the result of energetic photons being emitted by young massive stars, but the vast extent of the region shown by Webb is something of a surprise that bears further investigation. Another feature of the region that Crowe plans to examine further is the needle-like structures in the ionised hydrogen, which appear oriented chaotically in many directions.Around 25 000 light-years from Earth, the galactic centre is close enough to study individual stars with the Webb telescope, allowing astronomers to gather unprecedented information on how stars form, and how this process may depend on the cosmic environment, especially compared to other regions of the galaxy. For example, are more massive stars formed in the centre of the Milky Way, as opposed to the edges of its spiral arms?

The set of final tests were carried out at IABG in Germany and included positioning the satellite on a shaker to simulate the vibrations it will have to endure during liftoff, and enclosing it in a thermal vacuum chamber where it was exposed to the extreme swings in temperature that it will experience as it orbits Earth.

Arctic Weather Satellite up close The satellite is actually the forerunner of a potential constellation of satellites, called EPS-Sterna, that ESA would build for Eumetsat if this first prototype Arctic Weather Satellite works well.The EPS-Sterna mission is envisaged as a constellation of six microsatellites in three orbital planes to supply an almost constant stream of temperature and humidity data from every location on Earth.This would, for the first time, allow for very short-range weather forecasting, or ‘nowcasting’, in the Arctic. The set of six microsatellites would be replenished three times.While the Arctic is the focus, meteorologists will also use the constellation to improve weather forecasts globally.Embracing the concept of New Space, the prototype Arctic Weather Satellite has been developed and built on a very tight schedule of just 36 months and on a tight budget. Ville added, “Led by our prime contractor, OHB in Sweden, over 30 companies have been involved in the development of the mission. I think I can I speak for everyone in saying how thrilled we are to see the satellite fit and well and ready for its next steps.”The satellite is now being shipped back to Sweden for a last few checks before it is packed up ready for shipment to the Vandenberg launch site in California in the US.

Joining forces, the EC and ESA recently launched the Earth System Science Initiative to provide a coordinated response to critical environmental challenges and related scientific questions.The EC’s Research and Innovation Department and ESA’s Earth Observation Programmes Directorate are aligning a set of selected scientific activities under their respective Horizon Europe and FutureEO programmes.The aim is to match objectives, content and planning to jointly advance Earth system science and its contribution to responding to global challenges faced by society at large. EC–ESA Earth System Science Initiative The initiative, which covers a range of Earth-science topics, will improve Earth system models and, importantly, deliver science-based information and tools to help European authorities and citizens deal with environmental threats caused by climate change.John Bell, Director of Healthy Planet in the EC’s Directorate-General for Research & Innovation, said, “The EC–ESA Earth System Science Initiative contributes to our vision of a sustainable and resilient Europe.“Fostering the collaboration between projects funded by ESA’s FutureEO and our Horizon Europe programmes not only boosts the scientific output of the projects, but helps us deliver on the EU policy goals expressed in the European Green Deal, including climate change adaptation.”One priority area focuses on clouds and aerosols and their role in the climate system – which is also tied to preparing for ESA’s upcoming EarthCARE mission.Simonetta Cheli, ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, noted, “One of the new EC–ESA collaborative research actions focuses on the interactions between clouds, aerosols, incoming solar energy and energy emitted by our planet, which play a major role in our climate system. EarthCARE for a better understanding of Earth''s radiation balance “I look forward to seeing the outcomes, especially in light of our EarthCARE satellite which will be launched in a few months.”EarthCARE carries a set of four state-of-the-art instruments that work together to provide a holistic view of complex interplay between clouds, aerosols and radiation to yield new insight into the radiation balance against the backdrop of the climate crisis.The actual temperature at the surface of Earth is the result of a delicate balance between incoming radiation from the Sun, which heats it, and outgoing thermal radiation, which cools.Although it is known that clouds play an extremely important role in this balance, there still remains significant uncertainty about their role in the current and future climate system, and subsequently also on the exact impact that further greenhouse-gas emissions will have.Aerosols influence the life cycle of clouds and so contribute indirectly to their radiative effect. Albeit to a lesser extent, aerosols also reflect incoming solar energy back out to space and can trap outgoing infrared energy. Overall, clouds and aerosols currently have a net cooling effect, which is expected to decline in the future. Earth radiation budget Access the video With three new science projects funded, the EC–ESA collaboration brings together a group of outstanding scientists, who will link observations from the ground and from satellites with models and process studies.The group will make the best out of EarthCARE to advance climate models and to advise decision makers on the effectiveness of climate and air-quality policies.Vassilis Amiridis, Research Director at the National Observatory of Athens and key scientist for ESA’s AIRSENSE project, said, “Through improved representations of aerosols, clouds and their interactions with radiation, AIRSENSE will exploit the revolutionary EarthCARE mission to help unlock the prediction capability of Earth-system models.”Jennie Thomas, Project Coordinator at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and also coordinator for the EC-funded CERTAINTY project, added, “We combine modelling and observation expertise to understand cloud–aerosol processes and their links to global climate and society.

We need to close these knowledge gaps to be able to predict to what extent the Paris Agreement can be met and what changes lie ahead.” Director John Bell concluded, “The collaboration on aerosol and clouds will improve climate predictions and provide support to our regions to adapt to warming temperatures, thus also help achieve the goals on adaptation to climate change.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Ultra-precise and reliable atomic clocks are an essential pillar in satellite navigation, driving overall system performance and positioning accuracy. From the drawing board to being operational in space, a full technology innovation cycle can take up to a decade, so to keep Galileo at the forefront of global satnav ESA is continually undertaking research and development for the evolution of both Galileo and EGNOS via the EU programme Horizon Europe.Last month, ESA kicked off a new project to design, develop and qualify a new technology for atomic clocks. On behalf of the European Commission and after a formal selection process under open competition, ESA signed a contract for an amount of €12 million with a consortium formed by the Italian company Leonardo S.p.A as prime contractor and Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM) as subcontractor. As part of the R&D workplan for Galileo, ESA will also assess other clock technologies, the procurement of which is still ongoing.“The pulsed optically pumped rubidium atomic clock under development combines the robustness of rubidium vapour cell atomic clocks, largely used in satellite navigation constellations like Galileo, with state-of-the-art optical and digital technologies,” explains Manuela Rapisarda, GNSS Evolutions Payload Principal Engineer at ESA.Under this contract, the consortium will design, manufacture, test and qualify an engineering qualification model, after which an experimental flight model is expected to fly on a Galileo Second Generation satellite for early in-orbit verification. After initial tests, the new clock will still be monitored to study its reliability and long-term lifetime. Experimental clocks will fly in addition to the operational clocks that are used in the provision of Galileo services. Leonardo laboratory Galileo is one of the most crucial space-based infrastructures in Europe. “If qualified, the new clock technology will not only contribute to improving its performance but will guarantee Europe to stay at the forefront of atomic clock technology,” says Pascale Flagel, Head of Galileo and EGNOS Evolution Division.Apart from investing in the development of new clock technology, Horizon Europe is also running research and development activities on other aspects for the evolution of EGNOS and Galileo, both in space and on the ground, to leverage emerging trends and address evolving user needs. Mastering timekeeping in space Passive Hydrogen Maser on Galileo IOV The capability of a satellite navigation system to pinpoint a location stems from calculating the time it takes for a signal to travel from the satellite to a receiver. Galileo satellites orbit 23 222 km above Earth, transmitting signals that incorporate a time stamp. Since the propagation speed of the signal is known, the difference between the transmission and reception time determines the distance of the user with respect to the satellite. It is possible to determine the user position on Earth knowing its distance from at least four satellites.The signal transmitted by the satellite takes around a twelfth of a second to reach the user on Earth. Positioning accuracy is therefore linked to Galileo’s timing precision which needs to be within few nanoseconds – billionths of a second – in order to have a positioning accuracy of meters. Two generations of Galileo Currently, Galileo satellites of the first generation carry passive hydrogen masers, also developed by Leonardo and the most precise clocks in orbit to this date, and rubidium clocks, supplied by Safran. The new alternative atomic clock technology subject of the signed contract is expected to be even more precise than any of the current Galileo clocks, with a decrease in energy consumption and a mass reduction of more than 40% with respect to Galileo passive hydrogen maser clocks. With the ultra-precise clocks currently flying on Galileo, the new pulsed optically pumped rubidium atomic clock and other innovative clock technologies now in early research stages, Galileo is in an excellent position to evolve and remain the best satellite navigation system in the world. About Horizon Europe Horizon Europe is the EU’s key funding programme for the evolution of EGNOS and Galileo, to ensure continuity of service, increased accuracy of positioning and stronger robustness against threats.ESA has been entrusted with bringing innovative technologies for EGNOS and Galileo to maturity, reducing risks and securing operational systems for the future.

Genesis is a new ESA Navigation mission that has the goal to significantly contribute to improving the accuracy and stability of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). The ITRF is the foundation for all space- and ground-based observations in Navigation and Earth Sciences, and therefore this mission will potentially impact a large number of applications, from high precision navigation to climate and environmental monitoring. International cooperation is key to ensure the mission objectives arereached and to maximise the mission’s benefits.To meet this goal, the Genesis team has involved the scientific community at an early stage. On 29 February, over 100 scientists, representatives of international organisations and ESA experts met at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, home of the Navigation Support Office, and online, for the first Genesis science workshop.Representatives from the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), the International Association of Geodesy (IAG), the International GNSS Service (IGS), International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS), International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) and International DORIS Service (IDS), among others, had the opportunity to learn first-hand about the mission objectives and status. First meeting of the science community The project team shared a proposal for the involvement of the scientific community in this mission, with working groups and an initial structure for the Genesis Science Exploitation Team (GSET). The GSET’s role is to advise the project team on mission development, qualification, calibration and operations, and compliance assessment to the mission objectives, as well as to exploit the mission’s data in the future.The Genesis satellite will act as a geodetic (Earth-measuring) observatory in space that will carry instruments for the main geodetic techniques: very-long-baseline interferometry, satellite laser ranging, DORIS and satellite navigation. An ultra-stable oscillator on board will ensure the instruments are synchronised.The project team took the opportunity to present the Genesis processing, archiving and distribution centre that will process mission data, generate data products, disseminate and archive them, with participation from the ESOC Navigation Support Office and ESAC GNSS Science Support Centre. Genesis is approaching its official kick-off later this month, marked by the award of contracts to European industry. “The mission will be implemented in a fast pace, with a vision to provide the best outcome for mission exploitation within the programmatic boundaries,” said Genesis Project Manager Sara Gidlund. “This science workshop sets the scene for what we need to do in the coming years and establishes from the very beginning a good interface between ESA and the scientific community.”Head of Future Navigation Department Marco Falcone added: “We have been excited about Genesis and its huge potential since it was approved at the ESA Ministerial Council in November 2022. Genesis is a mission for the world, and ESA is proud to contribute towards the definition of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame down to millimetre accuracy.” About GENESIS GENESIS mission patch Genesis is a mission of the FutureNAV programme, an optional ESA Navigation programme with support from Italy, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Hungary and the UK. Genesis was approved at ESA’s Ministerial Council in 2022, as one of two FutureNAV programme missions.The goal of Genesis is to significantly contribute to improving the accuracy and stability of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). The ITRF serves as a reference frame for navigation systems and many measurements on Earth and in space.Improving the ITRF would impact high accuracy navigation applications with benefits in aviation, autonomous vehicle driving and traffic management, for example. In Earth sciences it would help refine models used for climate and environmental monitoring, among other applications.Genesis'' extreme accuracy is achieved by co-locating the main geodetic (Earth-measuring) techniques (satellite navigation, very-long-baseline interferometry, satellite laser ranging and DORIS) onboard one satellite that acts as a flying observatory.

The technology is funded under the ESA 5G/6G Programme with the support of the UK Space Agency. Self-driving vehicles may get around on their own, but they can only do so by being connected. Instead of relying on a driver’s eyes and instincts, self-driving vehicles know where they are, where they’re going and what is in their way based on data from cameras and sensors, and a constant connection to communication networks.The Darwin Autonomous Shuttle has been travelling around Harwell Science and Innovation Campus since November 2021, taking more than 1400 staff, contractors and visitors where they need to be through a combination of 4G, 5G and satellite connectivity. This allows the shuttle bus to remain constantly connected and tracked as it follows a four-kilometre route around Harwell Campus, operating six hours every working day and navigating roundabouts, zebra crossings, junctions, public roads and changing traffic. As the shuttle uses Darwin’s technology to connect seamlessly to the strongest network at any moment, it maintains a constant connection even if one network is unavailable.The Harwell shuttle uses lidar, cameras and ultrasound to map its local environment and react to any changes, such as from traffic or pedestrians. To support its positioning on the road, it is also fitted with a navigation antenna.Due to UK regulatory requirements, a safety operator must currently monitor the shuttle at all times. However, there is confidence that the shuttle will be able to run alone when regulations change. This would open up opportunities for on-demand shuttle services to isolated or rural areas which receive less regular public transportation, even enabling passengers to select specific destinations off-route.Data collected from this trial have already contributed to the first ‘smart insurance’ product being created for autonomous vehicles – a crucial step in allowing such vehicles on the road, for the safety of other vehicles and drivers alike.In December 2023, Darwin purchased a second shuttle, enabling the company to test longer service hours and the potential to provide entertainment services for passengers, such as video streaming and playing online video games.Driverless vehicles are now becoming a reality on our roads, and offer a real opportunity for economic and social development. Testing has been underway for a number of years to ensure the technology is robust, reliable and safe.ESA’s 5G/6G programme line has been a part of the technology’s evolution through co-funding the novel shuttle at Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, helping to understand the technical requirements and capabilities of self-driving vehicles.Future applications of the technology are not limited to shuttles or campuses. It is well-positioned to also support operations at industrial sites, ports and airports. Further development of the technology is also planned to enhance cyber-security and allow remote operation of the vehicle, increasing safety, reliability and ultimately confidence, and bringing it closer to becoming a day-to-day transport option.Antonio Franchi, Head of ESA’s 5G/6G programme line, said: “Working with the Darwin team to develop this technology is important to bringing the benefits of connected autonomous vehicles to our daily lives. They offer a vital tool in unlocking economic opportunities across Europe, as well as reducing the environmental impact of transportation services.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Understanding more about how seawater temperatures are rising and how oceans are absorbing excess atmospheric carbon dioxide, as well as knock-on issues such as ocean acidification, is key for understanding climate change and for taking effective action.A recent scientific paper highlights just how satellites are becoming increasingly important in providing unique information on ocean health to guide climate mitigation and adaptation efforts. Oceans are soaking up around 90% of the extra heat in the atmosphere caused by greenhouse-gas emissions from human activity, and they are also drawing down almost 30% of the carbon dioxide we pump into the atmosphere.Given the climate crisis, this sounds like a good thing, but in many places these processes are leading to a decrease in the pH of seawater, a phenomenon known as ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is detrimental to coral reefs Also, rising sea-surface temperatures can alter ocean circulation and weather patterns.Both issues not only impact the delicate balance of marine ecosystems but, ultimately, lead to cascading effects that have the potential to be felt worldwide.As oceans continue to warm and absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, improving our ability to monitor ocean-carbonate chemistry has become a priority.From the vantage of space, satellites return key information that offers the unique opportunity to study how greenhouse-gas emissions and a warming climate are affecting the health of our vast oceans.The paper published recently in the journal Earth Science Reviews highlights how ESA has supported successive research projects that have helped move the use of satellite data from ocean-carbon research to being a fundamental component of annual carbon assessments to guide policy.The paper charts how, over the last 16 years, research funded through ESA’s Earth Observation Science for Society activities has contributed to a giant leap in our knowledge of the world’s oceans. Global ocean acidification increase Jamie Shutler from the University of Exeter in the UK and lead author of the paper, said, “The advances we have made in our ability to understand and monitor ocean carbon has been amazing, but we have really only just begun to touch the tip of iceberg in what is actually possible from space.“The paper outlines what more can be done with the existing satellites and how we can even use data from missions that have long-since ceased operations – now that will be really exciting.“For example, the new ‘ocean pH stripes’ from a current ESA project visualise the change in ocean acidification as constructed from observations over the past 40 years. And this visualisation was used at the recent COP28 climate conference to highlight the plight of the ocean and the decline in ocean pH driven by greenhouse-gases emissions and climate change.” Global ocean acidification stripes Roberto Sabia, ESA Ocean Scientist, said, “We are thrilled that we are harvesting the potential of space-based salinity, temperature, wind speed and ocean colour data to characterise the spatial and temporal variability of the ocean carbon sink and related ocean acidification.“Over the past years, significant emphasis was put on improving algorithms relating variables in the marine carbonate system. Now, efforts are more devoted to analysing concurrent compound events such as marine heatwaves and deoxygenation, and to the involvement of ocean conservation stakeholders in the full exploitation of these datasets.”ESA’s Craig Donlon added, “Indeed we initiated research and development with the International Surface Ocean and Lower Atmosphere Study, SOLAS, back in 2008, and we now have data products that are used to guide policy on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.“We cannot understate the value of data from heritage missions such as ESA’s Envisat, data from our current mission such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite and from the Copernicus Sentinel series. These missions have also laid the foundation for upcoming missions like the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer, CIMR, satellites, which will help take our knowledge of oceans to the next level. Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer mission “We are currently developing CIMR for Copernicus – the Earth observation component of the European Union’s Space programme.“This new mission promises to be a game-changer and is urgently needed to study the upper ocean and polar regions using its multifrequency imaging capability with high-radiometric fidelity, multipolarisation and high-spatial resolution for this class of instrument. “In the next few years CIMR-A, and about six years later CIMR-B, will be on orbit for a minimum of 15 years providing unique measurements to support climate action in a time when the global ocean and polar regions are undergoing profound change.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

NanoMagSat will measure Earth’s magnetic field to help assess space weather hazards and continue on from ESA’s current Swarm mission. Tango will measure greenhouse-gas emissions from human activity and complements the upcoming Copernicus Carbon Dioxide Monitoring mission and the Sentinel-5 mission, as well as the current Sentinel-5P mission. The decision to make NanoMagSat and Tango a reality has been taken by ESA’s Earth Observation Programme Board following careful assessment as to their suitability as Scout missions and their ability to generate cutting-edge science.Scouts are small satellites that deliver value-added science, either by miniaturising existing space technologies or by demonstrating new observing techniques.In accordance with the New Space approach, Scouts follow a low-cost and short development process.A mission must cost less than €35 million and must be developed within three years, from kick-off to launch.In fact, NanoMagSat and Tango had been proposed to ESA a few years ago, but at the time they were not deemed technically mature enough. However, these technical issues have since been ironed out and the concepts now are sufficiently mature to be given the green light.ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, said, “We are very pleased to add two new Scouts to our Earth observation mission portfolio. These small science missions perfectly complement our more traditional existing and future Earth Explorer missions, and will bring exciting benefits to Earth science and to society.” NanoMagSat Following on from the current Swarm Earth Explorer mission, which was launched back in 2013, NanoMagSat aims to maintain Europe’s leadership in monitoring Earth’s magnetic field. In addition, NanoMagSat will measure the ionospheric environment.Although invisible, the magnetic field and electric currents in and around Earth generate complex forces that have immeasurable impact on everyday life. However, the magnetic field is in a permanent state of flux.Overall, NanoMagSat will allow for a much-improved understanding of the dynamics of the magnetic field and of the role of the Sun in the coupled atmospheric–ionospheric–magnetospheric system.Information delivered by NanoMagSat will be used in many ways, such as for space weather hazard assessments, precise navigation, reference models for smart phones, directional drilling and in the World Magnetic Model.The mission will comprise a constellation of three 16U satellites, launched nine months apart.Each 24-kg satellite will carry a miniaturised absolute magnetometer at the end of a boom and a high-frequency magnetometer half-way along the boom for magnetic measurements, a Langmuir probe to measure electron temperature and density, and two GNSS receivers.The Tango mission will measure and monitor three greenhouse gases: methane, carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide being emitted from large industrial sites. Tango satellites imaging Earth This new Tango Scout mission will complement measurements of methane and nitrogen dioxide from the current Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission and the upcoming Copernicus Carbon Dioxide Monitoring mission which will measure carbon dioxide and methane from human activity to help verify the Paris Agreement.Tango will monitor 150–300 known large industrial facilities and power plants every four days. It will deliver high-resolution images of emission plumes as well as the surrounding pollution, with sufficient accuracy to determine emissions with a single observation. In fact, Tango will deliver higher-resolution images at these specific locations compared to the other three missions noted above provide, so therefore acts as a magnifying glass. The Tango mission will comprise two 25-kg satellites orbiting in tandem: one configured to measure methane and carbon dioxide and one to measure nitrogen dioxide.NanoMagSat and Tango now join HydroGNSS as ESA Scout missions.HydroGNSS, which, having passed a milestone review, is about to undergo testing. Once launched, it will use GNSS reflectometry for observations of essential climate variables relevant to the hydrological cycle. These variables include soil moisture, freeze–thaw over permafrost, above-ground biomass and ocean-wind speed. It will consist of one micro-satellite, and one additional satellite as an option.

However, the region is also grappling with a persistent environmental challenge: air pollution. The unique geographical and meteorological conditions of the Po Valley contribute to fluctuations in air quality – impacting the health of its residents. The Po Valley is a densely populated region and is also highly industrialised resulting in large quantities of pollutants released into the atmosphere. Its geography and characteristic weather patterns exacerbate the problem.The Po Valley, surrounded by the Alps to the north and the Apennines to the south, acts as a natural basin, creating a microclimate that often traps pollutants. During certain weather conditions, such as temperature inversions, the valley becomes a bowl where pollutants, including particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, accumulate, leading to elevated concentrations of air pollutants.Air pollution in the Po Valley exhibits distinct seasonal patterns. Winter months often see increased pollution levels due to temperature inversions and higher energy demand for heating. Blanketed Po Valley During these periods, fine and coarse particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) concentrations tend to spike, leading to health concerns. In contrast, summer months may witness elevated ozone levels, stemming from increased solar radiation and the presence of precursors (nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds) emitted from various sources.The fluctuations in air pollution levels in the Po Valley, and around the world, have significant repercussions for human health and the environment.Air pollution in the form of particulate matter (PM) plays a pivotal role in air quality. PM10 refers to particles suspended in ambient air with an average diameter of 10 μm or less and comprises dust, pollen and combustion byproducts. PM10 also includes the fine particle fraction (PM2.5), consisting of a mixture of elemental carbon, organic compounds, metals, nitrates, and sulphates, with particles smaller than 2.5 μm.PM10 is inhalable and can impact respiratory health; PM2.5 poses health risks by entering the bloodstream through the lungs, causing cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and allergies. Accumulation of both PM2.5 and PM10 therefore constitute serious concerns for human health.According to EU directives and legal standards, concentrations of PM10 exceeding 50 μg/m3 are deemed dangerous, and this threshold should not be surpassed for any location for a specified number of days annually, typically set at 35 days.However, recent observations indicate that in January 2024, there have been multiple instances where this critical threshold was exceeded.Despite the prevalent air pollution in the Po Valley, levels of air pollutants above EU standards are consistently observed across Europe with the region regularly surpassing its annual average concentrations of fine particulate matter, as reported by the European Environmental Agency (EEA). This raises notable concerns for environmental health. Air quality over the Po Valley Access the video The animation above shows hourly concentrations of PM10 across the Po Valley from 1 January to 31 January 2024. It can be seen clearly that the valley''s unique topography and meteorological conditions contribute to the accumulation of particulate matter pollution and degraded air quality – particularly during stagnant weather patterns. The data was obtained from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) European regional air quality analyses.Copernicus satellites play a crucial role in supplying vital data to CAMS. CAMS monitors and forecasts air quality on a global and regional scale by combining satellite and in situ observations of key air pollutants with state-of-the-art numerical models which take into account the chemical transformation, transport and dispersion.CAMS is one of the six data services of the EU’s Copernicus Programme, providing value added information on atmospheric composition and air quality based on Earth observation and in situ measurements.Global forecasts of atmospheric composition are provided for five days in advance using the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) and regional forecasts of air quality for the European domain are provided for four days in advance using a suite of 11 regional air quality models. All data are fully open access and available to anybody that wants to use them.Looking ahead, ESA’s EarthCARE cloud and aerosol mission, scheduled for launch in May, is poised to complement the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite, currently in orbit, and the upcoming Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 missions.These Copernicus missions are dedicated to atmospheric composition and will provide observations of several air quality drivers including ozone, aerosol and related precursors such as nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide.EarthCARE, on the other hand, will provide unprecedented insights into the vertical distribution of particle burden and processes that drive its evolution. Equipped with advanced remote sensing capabilities, EarthCARE will contribute valuable data to enhance our understanding of air pollution dynamics.

As well as leaving a remarkable legacy of data that still continue to advance science, this outstanding mission set the stage for many of today’s satellites and ESA’s position at the forefront of Earth observation.In 2011, ESA retired ERS-2 and began the process of deorbiting – and now it’s time for this pioneering satellite to reenter the atmosphere naturally and start to burn up. ERS-2 was launched in 1995 following on from its sister satellite, ERS-1, which had been launched four years earlier.At their time of launch, the two ERS satellites were the most sophisticated Earth observation satellites ever developed. ERS satellites Access the video Both satellites carried an impressive package of instruments including an imaging synthetic aperture radar, a radar altimeter and other powerful sensors to measure ocean-surface temperature and winds at sea. ERS-2 had an additional sensor to measure atmospheric ozone.These ground-breaking ESA satellites collected a bounty of data on Earth’s diminishing polar ice, changing land surfaces, sea-level rise, warming oceans and atmospheric chemistry. In addition, were called upon to monitor natural disasters such as severe floods and earthquakes in remote parts of the world.The various technologies pioneered on ERS set the stage for successor missions such as the hugely successful Envisat mission, the MetOp weather satellites, today’s family of Earth Explorer scientific research missions and the Copernicus Sentinels as well as many other national satellite missions, paving the way for the routine observations that we take for granted today. Greenland ice-sheet from ERS, Envisat and CryoSat missions between 1992 and 2016 For example, the ERS radar was the forerunner of the radar on today’s Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission, its radar altimeter provided heritage for the sensor on the CryoSat Earth Explorer mission to map changes in ice thickness and the ERS radiometer lives on in the version carried on Copernicus Sentinel-3.ERS-2''s Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) was the forerunner of Sciamachy on Envisat and GOME-2 on MetOp.Back when ERS-2 was launched the notion of climate change was far less appreciated and understood than it is today – but the ERS missions gave scientists the data that helped us to begin to understand the impact that humans are having on the planet.Thousands of scientific papers have been published based on ERS data, and thanks to ESA’s Heritage Space Programme, which ensures that data from now-inactive satellites continue to be improved and used, more findings on our changing world and the risks we face will still emerge. Elevations Bachu, China, from the two ERS satellites ERS-2 was still functioning when ESA declared the mission complete in 2011 and subsequently embarked upon lowering its altitude from about 785 km to 573 km to minimise the risk of collision with other satellites, and fully passivated the satellite.ERS-2’s disposal was conducted considering ESA''s space debris mitigation requirements at that time to new projects, demonstrating the Agency’s strong commitment to reduce space debris.After 13 years of orbital decay, mainly driven by solar activity, the satellite will now naturally reenter Earth’s atmosphere. This is expected to happen around mid-February, with predictions improving the closer we get to reentry point.ESA’s Space Debris Office is, of course, monitoring the satellite’s orbit decay very closely in coordination with several international partners, and will provide regular updates in the days leading up to reentry on both the ESA''s Reentry Predictions Page and the Rocket Science Blog.

Carrying four different instruments, this remarkable satellite is the most complex of ESA’s Earth Explorer missions – missions that return key scientific information that advances our understanding of how planet Earth works as a system and the impact that humans are having on natural processes.With the climate crisis increasingly tightening its grip, the Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer, or EarthCARE for short, was developed to shed new light on the complex interactions between clouds, aerosols and radiation within the Earth’s atmosphere. EarthCARE over Europe Access the video Energy in the atmosphere is a balance between incoming radiation from the Sun, which heats the Earth system, and outgoing thermal radiation, which cools Earth. Although it is known that clouds play an extremely important role in atmospheric heating and cooling, they remain one of the biggest uncertainties in our understanding of how the atmosphere drives the climate system.Clouds and, to a lesser extent, aerosols reflect incoming solar energy back out to space, but they also trap outgoing infrared energy. This leads to a net effect of either cooling or heating. In addition, aerosols influence the life cycle of clouds and so contribute indirectly to their radiative effect.EarthCARE’s set of four state-of-the-art instruments will work together to provide a holistic view of complex interplay between clouds, aerosols and radiation to yield new insight into Earth’s radiation balance against the backdrop of the climate crisis. Cleaning EarthCARE With liftoff slated for May on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, EarthCARE has been going through the last round of tests and meticulous checks in Germany.Now ready to be declared fit to travel, the two-tonne EarthCARE satellite has been standing proud on display in a cleanroom at Airbus’ facilities in Friedrichshafen.ESA’s EarthCARE Project Manager, Dirk Bernaerts, said, “It’s great to see EarthCARE in all its glory and I’m extremely proud of what ESA, JAXA and our industrial partners have achieved in developing this extraordinary mission.“As a hugely complex mission, it has been a rather long road, but it now comes at a critical time in the development of global climate models that are starting to resolve cloud convection at kilometre scales – we talk about it now being ‘the age of convection’.“EarthCARE is certainly poised to make an important contribution to complicated climate models and numerical weather prediction.” ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, commented, “EarthCARE will soon add to our growing family of pioneering Earth Explorer research missions. So far, all these missions have exceeded their scientific goals and expectations – and I fully expect EarthCARE will follow suit.“Although EarthCARE is an ESA mission, we pay special thanks to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA, which has supplied the cloud profiling radar, one of the satellites key measuring instruments.”JAXA’s Vice President, Koji Terada, added, “Despite the mission being proposed as concept over 20 years ago, EarthCARE is more relevant than ever. I am deeply impressed that the mission is based on such excellent and visionary science requirements. We are very proud to offer the cloud profiling radar for the mission.” EarthCARE for a better understanding of Earth''s radiation balance The satellite’s cloud profiling radar provides information on the vertical structure and internal dynamics of clouds, its atmospheric lidar delivers cloud-top information and profiles of thin clouds and aerosols, its multispectral imager offers a wide-scene overview in multiple wavelengths, and its broadband radiometer measures reflected solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation.Airbus EarthCARE Project Leader, Maximilian Sauer, said, “EarthCARE took 15 years to develop with experts involved from over 15 countries in Europe as well as Canada, US and Japan. And thanks to this hard work we have a satellite that is set to enhance climate models.“This is also a great achievement for colleagues from three different Airbus sites and for more than 40 subcontracting companies that have been involved.”Walther Pelzer, Director General of the German Space Agency, DLR, noted, “The EarthCARE satellite was built in Germany. Furthermore, a lot of German companies and scientific institutions are involved in the mission.

Galileo was not designed to comply with these strict safety requirements, so how did engineers at ESA achieve this feat? This is a tale of engineering excellence. Take-off, a critical phase of flight In civil aviation, especially for critical stages such as final approaches, navigation systems need to be extremely reliable. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines the strict requirements that systems need to fulfil to be used in these so-called Safety-of-Life operations, where a malfunction of the system would lead to major human or environmental catastrophes.Galileo was never designed to comply with these rigorous integrity standards as Europe already had EGNOS, a dedicated Safety-of-Life system for navigation. EGNOS ‘augments’ GPS signals for critical operations in aviation, maritime navigation, agriculture and more. But in 2016, ESA joined forces with the European Commission (EC) and the EU Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) to elevate Galileo’s reliability and make it fit for civil aviation, as a standalone support system during en route and augmented by EGNOS at take-off and landing.With 18 satellites already orbiting the Earth in 2016, and the deployment of the remainder in full swing, redesigning the whole system was not an option, so the team buckled down with flexible thinking and a creative mind, in true ESA style, to push the boundaries of engineering. Galileo, strong since born Since Galileo’s first position fix in 2013 and as the constellation grew, it was clear to ESA engineers that it was a sturdy navigation system, already meeting and exceeding all expectations. “Galileo was not even in service yet when from the EGNOS team we suggested it should be used for civil aviation – that is how confident we were about its performance,” remembers ESA Head of EGNOS and SBAS Division Didier Flament.With precious support from European industry, most notably Thales Alenia Space and Airbus Defence and Space, the team set to gather evidence of Galileo’s robustness and reliability. They scrutinised nearly one million in-service hours, looking closely at every anomaly and its magnitude, duration, root cause and impact. They found that only six events in the history of Galileo exceeded the standards set by ICAO, and none of them were affecting more than a single satellite at a time. Galileo system test bed operations room Modify, retune, strengthen Galileo antenna at Kiruna The next step was to modify the system to mitigate the effects of the (very few) potential malfunctions. The only leverage was the intricate ground segment, as the satellites were already in orbit. “The solution was not obvious at all! We threw many and varied ideas on the table when we were looking for the right solution, from adding more stations to using data from the anticipated High Accuracy Service,” explains Galileo Safety-of-Life System Engineer Santiago Perea.Finally, ESA engineers devised a set of strategic actions to improve the detection of faulty measurements by adding barriers in the ground segment and to notify receivers to exclude these defective readings from their calculations. “In the end, not a single infrastructure or hardware element was touched; we improved the monitoring and notification capabilities of Galileo purely by retuning the software in the ground segment,” explains Stefan Wallner, Head of Galileo Signal-in-Space Engineering Unit. International Civil Aviation Organization Equipped with a dossier packed with evidence of Galileo’s reliability and having provided a commitments checklist to EUSPA, the Galileo partnership approached ICAO, who finally endorsed Galileo for Safety-of-Life civil aviation operations in March 2023. Safer skies with European satellite navigation With this achievement, ESA is changing the game for aviation, as now European satellite navigation can guide every phase of a flight.In practical terms, this means that aircraft manufacturers can now build receivers which autonomously monitor Galileo (together with GPS) signal integrity without the need for external corrections or fault detection to support non-critical phases of flight, including parts of the ascent, descent and enroute. In addition, Galileo is now ready to be augmented by the new version of EGNOS to support critical operations like landing, where satellite navigation systems like Galileo or GPS alone cannot offer enough reliability. Galileo Safety-of-Life team “This technological achievement has been possible thanks to ESA’s extraordinary in-house talent and to the excellent performance of Galileo: the system has shown high flexibility and adaptability to adhere to demanding standards it was never designed for,” remarks ESA’s Head of Galileo System Engineering Jörg Hahn.The long-standing cooperation between ESA with its partners EC and EUSPA, as well as with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), air navigation service providers and other national authorities has also been crucial in this success story. The second generation of the Galileo programme, now under development, will take a step further: a new facility will generate an Integrity Support Message that will tell the user the system can be trusted. An engineering prototype is already testing this new feature at ESTEC, ESA’s technical heart in the Netherlands. All developments go hand in hand with the implementation of EGNOS V3, capable of augmenting not only GPS but also Galileo, making European and global skies even safer. About Galileo Galileo is currently the world’s most precise satellite navigation system, serving close to four billion users around the globe since entering Open Service in 2017. All smartphones sold in the European Single Market are now guaranteed Galileo-enabled. In addition, Galileo is making a difference across the fields of rail, maritime, agriculture, financial timing services and rescue operations.Galileo is a flagship programmes of the EU Space Programme, managed and funded by the European Union. Since its inception, ESA leads the design, development and qualification of the space and ground systems, as well as procuring launches.

The ground-breaking Iris programme, led by ESA and communications company Viasat, digitally connects pilots with air traffic controllers, via satellites, enabling the more efficient routing of flights. As well as saving time, it is predicted that, through reduced fuel burn, carbon dioxide emissions could be cut significantly. This will contribute to the aim of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, which ESA aims to accelerate through working with partners to deliver tangible and measurable contributions.Several airlines are in the pipeline to sign up to use Iris, and easyJet was the first airline to make an inaugural flight using the technology on its Amsterdam – Milan route. Iris will continue to be rolled out by easyJet, with more aircraft being equipped with the technology during 2024. The inaugural flight using the Iris technology - Image courtesy of John Ballantyne By using satellite communications, Iris provides secure, reliable and fast high-bandwidth links between pilots and air traffic controllers. This complements the current use of radio frequencies that are nearing full capacity in Europe’s congested airspace. The system supports more direct flight paths, leading to shorter flying times with less fuel burn and therefore generating lower emissions. Passengers will also benefit directly, with fewer delays.Iris is also in the front line to put the Single European Skies initiative into action. Single European Skies aims to tackle the fragmentation of European airspace, with improvements in safety, capacity, cost-efficiency and environmental impact.While easyJet is the first airline to use Iris for a commercial flight, other European airlines will also equip aircraft with Iris. For example, Italy’s national carrier ITA Airways has confirmed it would join the programme.Iris is set for expansion beyond Europe. Called Iris Global, this next phase of the project will also see the system developed for potential use in remotely piloted aircraft systems. Operating beyond visual line of sight, such aircraft would gain a vital safety benefit from the extra layer of resilience that the Iris satellite communications provide.Javier Benedicto, Acting Director of Connectivity and Secure Communications at ESA, said: “These first Iris commercial flights put Europe firmly at the forefront of the digitalisation and modernisation of Air Traffic Management. Iris enables tangible benefits to the commercial aviation community and society at large, including reduced emissions of carbon dioxide and fewer delays for passengers through more efficient flight paths.“As a follow on of Iris, Iris global, which was launched in 2022, aims to extend the benefit of Iris beyond Europe. This will be achieved through geographical expansion, including Asia, the USA, the Middle East and Australia, and through service expansions by adding new ICAO aviation standards as well as new satellite-based communication solutions for supporting future air traffic management of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems. We are very proud to share this historic milestone for commercial aviation with the ESA Member States that have funded Iris activities and that will continue to support it in the future.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Astonishingly, the study reveals that around 75% of the world''s industrial fishing vessels have previously been ‘dark’ to public tracking systems. The study, published recently in the journal Nature, was led by Global Fishing Watch – an organisation that seeks to advance ocean governance through increased transparency of human activity at sea.Not all boats are legally required to broadcast their position, but vessels not included in public monitoring systems, often termed ‘dark fleets’, can pose challenges for protecting and managing natural resources. Map reveals untracked fishing vessels around Sicily and Tunisia By using five years’ worth of radar data from the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission and some optical data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission along with GPS information, researchers from Global Fishing Watch were able to identify ships that had not declared their positions.By then applying machine learning to the data, the researchers could conclude which of the vessels were engaged in fishing.The study period spanned 2017–2021 and covered coastal waters across six continents where the vast majority of fishing and offshore infrastructure are concentrated.They found numerous dark fishing vessels inside many marine protected areas, and a high concentration of vessels in many countries’ waters that previously showed little-to-no vessel activity by public monitoring systems.It also transpired that more than 25% of transport and energy vessel activity was also missing from tracking systems.“A new industrial revolution has been emerging in our seas undetected, until now,” said David Kroodsma, Director of Research and Innovation at Global Fishing Watch.“On land, we have detailed maps of almost every road and building on the planet. In contrast, growth in our ocean has been largely hidden from public view. This study helps eliminate the blind spots and sheds light on the breadth and intensity of human activity at sea.” Map reveals fishing activity not publicly tracked around Portugal and Morocco Fernando Paolo, Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Global Fishing Watch, added “Historically, vessel activity has been poorly documented, limiting our understanding of how the world’s largest public resource – the ocean – is being used.“By combining space technology with state-of-the-art machine learning, we mapped undisclosed industrial activity at sea on a scale never done before.”Publicly-available data suggests that Asia and Europe have a similar number of fishing vessels within their relative borders – however, this is not the case.Jennifer Raynor, Assistant Professor of Natural Resource Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said, “Our mapping reveals that Asia dominates. For every 10 fishing vessels we found on the water, seven were in Asia while only one was in Europe.“By revealing dark vessels, we have created the most comprehensive public picture of global industrial fishing available.” ESA’s Copernicus Sentinel-1 Mission Manager, Nuno Miranda, noted, “We are taken aback by the results of the study, I don’t think anyone expected that 75% of vessels at sea are not broadcasting their positions.“We are extremely proud of the preponderant role played by Sentinel-1 in these astonishing results.“The mission truly demonstrates how the all-weather, day and night imaging capacity of radar combined with its systematic and global observations allow for a better understanding of the scale at which humans are impacting the environment and natural resources.”As well as the implications this has on targeting vessels that could be fishing illegally, these results will also help understand more about greenhouse gases being emitted at sea. Offshore infrastructure The study also looked at offshore infrastructure such as wind turbines and oil platforms.During the study period, oil structures increased by 16% and wind turbines more than doubled. By 2021, turbines outnumbered oil platforms. China’s offshore wind energy had the most striking growth, increasing ninefold between 2017 and 2021.This is important for helping to understand development impacts and trends.

Join us as we revisit some of the most memorable stories from 2023. 10) We celebrated 25 years of Copernicus ‘Europe’s eyes on Earth’ started in 1998 as an idea for an operational environmental monitoring programme. Twenty-five years later, Copernicus is in full swing. With seven Copernicus Sentinel satellites in orbit, along with the contributing missions, terabytes of free and open data and information services are provided daily to hundreds of thousands of users.The data help address some of today’s key challenges such as diminishing polar ice, food security, rising sea levels, natural disasters and, of course, climate change.To celebrate the anniversary, browse through some of the highlights brought to you by Copernicus. 9) We spotted smelly seaweed from space $(window).load(function() { $(".twentytwenty-container").twentytwenty({ default_offset_pct: 0.5, orientation: ''horizontal'', before_label: "True colour", after_label: "Infrared channel", set_container_height: true, move_slider_on_hover: false, move_with_handle_only: true, click_to_move: false });}); Sargassum spotted by Copernicus Sentinel-2 Open Image Sargassum is a large brown seaweed that floats in masses along the ocean surface. It is an important habitat for marine species providing food refuge and breeding grounds. It also absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and converts it into organic carbon. However, when tonnes of it collects along coastlines, it rots – emitting toxins like hydrogen sulphide which produces a pungent smell.This year’s bloom spanned more than 8800 km from the shores of Africa to the Gulf of Mexico and weighed around 10 million tonnes – so large that it was visible from space. Images from Copernicus Sentinel-2 showed the Sargassum around 45 km off the west coast of Guadeloupe.It was predicted to be the largest ever recorded, but then unexpectedly shrunk.Read the full story: Smelly seaweed bloom heads to Florida 8) We counted wildfires across the globe Worldwide fires from ESA’s World Fire Atlas This summer, devastating wildfires spread across Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Algeria and Canada – causing massive environmental and economic damage, as well as human casualties.In light of the fires, ESA reopened its World Fire Atlas which offers insights into the distributions of individual fires taking place at both a national and global scale.The dashboard uses night-time data from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on board the Copernicus Sentinel-3A satellite. Working like a thermometer in the sky, the sensor measures thermal infrared radiation to take the temperature of Earth''s land surfaces which is used to detect the fires.In many of these outbreaks, the Copernicus Emergency Mapping Service was activated. The service uses satellite observations to help civil protection authorities and, in cases of disaster, the international humanitarian community, respond to emergencies.Read full story: Counting wildfires across the globe 7) Ice loss from Antarctica and Greenland hit a record low Ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica Access the video A report from the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Intercomparison Exercise stated that between 1992 and 2020, the polar ice sheets lost 7560 billion tonnes of ice – equivalent to an ice cube measuring 20 km each side.The polar ice sheets have together lost ice in every year of the satellite record, and the seven highest melting years have occurred in the last decade. Melting peaked in 2019, when the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets lost a staggering 612 billion tonnes of ice.Scientists use data from satellites such as ESA’s CryoSat and the Copernicus Sentinel-1 to measure changes in ice volume and flow, as well as satellites that provide information on gravity, to work out how much ice is being lost.Read full story: Ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica hits new record 6) We watched an iceberg larger than London break free Radar images capture new Antarctic mega-iceberg Access the video Glaciologists have monitored the many cracks and chasms that have formed in the thick Brunt Ice Shelf, which borders the Coats Land coast in the Weddell Sea sector of Antarctica, for years. It was only a matter of time that the A-81 iceberg would break free.After several years of desperately clinging on, satellite imagery confirmed the enormous iceberg finally calved on 22 January from Antarctica’s Brunt Ice Shelf. The iceberg, which is around 1550 sq km – around the size of Greater London or five times the size of Malta – is currently floating near the ice edge of the Ronne Ice Shelf, about 600 km from where it calved.Routine monitoring from satellites offers unparalleled views of events happening in remote regions. The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission carries radar, which can return images regardless of day or night and this allows us year-round viewing.Read the full story: Giant iceberg breaks away from Antarctic ice shelf 5) 2023 set to be hottest year on record Heatwave across Europe The WMO provisional State of the Global Climate report confirms that 2023 is set to be the warmest year on record. Data until the end of October shows that the year was about 1.40°C above the pre-industrial 1850—1900 baseline.The warming El Niño event, which emerged during the Northern Hemisphere spring of 2023 and developed rapidly during summer, is likely to further fuel the heat in 2024 because El Niño typically has the greatest impact on global temperatures after it peaks.Data from the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission’s radiometer instrument show the land surface temperature on in July 2023. Land surface temperature is how hot the ‘surface’ of Earth feels to the touch. Air temperature, given in our daily weather forecasts, is a measure of how hot the air is above the ground.Link to full story: Europe braces for sweltering July 4) Three Sentinel satellites mapped methane super-emitters Sentinel-5P detected methane plumes Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas contributor to climate change after carbon dioxide. Typically, methane emissions are monitored by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite. But this year, scientists combined data from multiple satellites to monitor methane from space for the very first time.Researchers from the SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research spotted a continuous methane emission from a leaking facility using data from the Tropomi instrument on Sentinel-5P. They then used a Sentinel-2 image to zoom in on the plumes’ origins and pinpointed the exact location of the leak, while Sentinel-3 showed the leak continued for six days.Combining the data from these satellites allows researchers to zoom in with precision, identifying, quantifying and monitoring methane sources corresponding to plumes observed in Sentinel-5P’s global scans.Read the full story: Trio of Sentinel satellites map methane super-emitters 3) Ozone hole in 2023 was one of the biggest on record Ozone hole extension 2023 Much like the sea ice around Antarctica which grows and retreats each year, the ozone hole fluctuates on a regular basis.Observations from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite indicate that the ozone hole or ‘ozone depleting area’ reached a size of around 26 million sq km on 16 September 2023 – making it one of the largest seasonal holes ever observed. This is roughly three times the size of Brazil.One possible reason for this year’s unusual ozone patterns could be associated with the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha''apai in January 2022, which injected massive quantities of water vapour into the stratosphere. Despite the large seasonal growth this year, the ozone hole is still decreasing in size overall. Scientists currently predict that the global ozone layer will reach its normal state again by around 2050.Read the full story: Ozone hole goes large again 2) We said goodbye to a historic mission – Aeolus Journey back to Earth: Aeolus'' historic reentry Access the video This year we said goodbye to the Aeolus wind mission – one of ESA’s most successful Earth observation missions. As an Earth Explorer, the satellite was designed as a research mission and to demonstrate new space technology.Surpassing scientific expectations and exceeding its planned life in orbit, the Aeolus wind mission reentered Earth’s atmosphere on 28 July at around 21:00 CEST above Antarctica. This was the first-of-its-kind assisted reentry and set a new standard for the safe reentry of satellites and space debris mitigation.Read the full story: Aeolus: a historic end to a trailblazing mission 1) We entered a new era of satellite meteorology Lightning over Europe The Meteosat Third Generation Imager not only delivered its first view of Earth this year, but also provided us with striking animations of lightning – confirming its capability of revolutionising the detection and prediction of severe storms.The Meteosat Third Generation Imager-1 is the first of six satellites that form the full MTG system. When fully operational, the system will provide critical data for short-term and early detection of potential extreme weather events over the next 20 years.Its first image of Earth revealed a level of detail about weather over Europe and Africa not previously possible from 36 000 km away. Just a few months later, the satellite’s Lightning Imager was switched on. The Lightning Imager is the first-ever satellite instrument capable of continuously detecting lightning across Europe and Africa and its capabilities promise to revolutionise the detection and prediction of severe storms.Read the full stories: New weather satellite reveals spectacular images of Earth and European satellite strikes lightning Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

But all the work being done to make it happen hinges on this single item at ESA’s Navigation Laboratory at ESTEC. The G2 test user receiver is designed to quantify the improvements the Second Generation will bring compared to current satellite navigation systems and will be used to verify the performance of early receivers processing the first G2 signals in space. Today, with 28 satellites in orbit, Galileo is the world’s most precise satellite navigation system, providing metre-level accuracy to more than four billion users around the globe. There are currently 10 further Galileo satellites ready to be launched, after which the first of the Galileo Second Generation (G2) satellites are expected to start joining the constellation.“In the end, everything we design has the goal of benefiting users,” explains Jose Antonio Garcia Molina, heading ESA’s Radio Navigation Systems and Techniques Section and leading the G2 signal-in-space design at ESA. “So, what we need to do before G2 satellites are ready to offer their novel services is to confirm that the system and signals we develop will indeed deliver their expected benefits.” This is the job of the test receiver which can capture and process all G2 services and signals-in-space for civilian use.Two test receivers for G2 have been designed through parallel contracts: one by GMV in Madrid and the other one by Airbus Defence and Space in Munich. The devices have been installed in ESA’s Navigation Laboratory at ESTEC, in the Netherlands. Navigation Lab For the time being, the receiver will be working solely with simulated signals produced by the G2 constellation simulators, two devices currently being developed by GMV/Orolia and Airbus/Ifen. At a later stage the receivers will be used with actual satellite signals during radio frequency and system compatibility tests, performed in advance of the satellite launches. It will also be employed for in-orbit testing and for the first in-orbit validation position fixes, similar to the first G1 position fix 10 years ago.“One of the reasons the G2 test user receiver is so valuable is its flexibility,” explains Enik Shytermeja, technology development engineer at ESA, “it can reproduce the performance of different types of receivers in various simulated environments”. ESA radionavigation engineer Francesca Zanier offers examples: “We can check how basic single-frequency smartphones will work with G2 signals both in optimal conditions and in more challenging situations, such as in built-up urban canyons. We can also simulate automotive receivers, sophisticated multi-frequency receivers used for surveying and low-end Internet of Things receivers with strict processing and power limitations”. Ever-evolving excellence Nav Lab rooftop antennas The novel receiver is being used to assess new signals and services that would be layered on top of the legacy Galileo ones as part of the system’s evolution, like the so-called Quasi-Pilot and Data Signal that are to be introduced with Galileo’s Second Generation, following initial positive test phase on Galileo’s First Generation. “Galileo already delivers the most precise positioning service in the world,” explains ESA’s Head of G2 System Engineering Unit Gustavo Lopez, “but we are always striving to make it even better”.The Quasi-Pilot service will enable faster positioning on basic receivers such as the ones in smartphones and Internet of Things devices by transmitting a simpler signal that requires less calculation. Data Signal will also enable a faster time-to-first-fix, even for users in urban environments and without Internet connection, by having each satellite transmit data from multiple satellites. Quasi-Pilot and Data Signal will complement each other to provide maximum flexibility for future services, according to ESA’s Galileo Second Generation Project Manager Miguel Manteiga Bautista, who is convinced that the population worldwide will greatly benefit from their combination.

The ALISIO-1 satellite was developed under an ESA Pioneer Partnership Project with satellite manufacturer and operator Open Cosmos, based at Harwell in the UK. ALISIO-1 carries two payloads. The first is an imager designed and developed at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias, an astrophysical research institute in the Canary Islands, Spain. This will serve various purposes, including the monitoring of wildfires and volcanic activity. The second is a communication terminal that uses a laser to transmit data, offering several advantages over the more typically used radio frequency communication methods. For example, data are transferred at a higher level of security, due to the narrow beam nature of laser signals. This marks a big step forward for future space missions and satellite communications, where robust and secure communication are vital.This satellite also validated a suite of technologies to build, test and operate satellites where every test is recorded as a digital history throughout the satellite’s lifecycle, during both the development and the operational phases. This will enable faster identification and resolution of any problems encountered and will enhance the capability of Open Cosmos to deliver space missions faster, more reliably and more affordably.The satellite was launched on 1 December, onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, in the United States.This development has been supported by the ESA Pioneer Partnership Projects, which is part of ESA’s Advanced Research in Telecommunications Systems (ARTES) 4.0 programme, with funding from the UK Space Agency.Stephane Lascar, Head of Satellite Programmes Department, Directorate of Connectivity and Secure Communications at ESA, said: “The successful launch of the ALISIO-1 mission, as part of the ESA Pioneer Partnership Project SAPION, demonstrates the high value and effectiveness of the Pioneer programme. Through this programme ESA supports European New Space industry to develop, grow and demonstrate in orbit their space business solutions and become Space Mission Providers."Florian Deconinck, Vice President for Growth at Open Cosmos, said: “The Pioneer partnership is instrumental in developing space missions in an affordable, efficient and reliable manner for customers. We have been able to digitalise many parts of the mission lifecycle process, from design to test recording as well as operations. This is fundamental to growing our business capability for satellite constellations, increasing our delivery speed while maintaining our impeccable 100% reliability in orbit. Our innovation combined with ESA’s expertise and guidance illustrates how NewSpace and legacy space can join forces to help address some of the biggest challenges.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

The ‘Little Pictures’ competition challenged the continent’s creative talent to design compelling illustrations using the range of global observation records available from ESA, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (Eumetsat) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), to highlight the key changes taking place across the climate. The winning ‘Little Picture’, created by scientific illustrator Sacha Berna of the University of Caen, France, highlights the expansion of Brazil’s urban area between 2000–2015 and compared it to the changes in rainforest coverage.To create the Little Picture, Sacha drew on satellite-derived land cover information generated by ESA’s Climate Change Initiative. Land cover – the bio-physical surface of Earth’s land area – and its change over time is known to influence regional and global climate by modifying exchange of water, energy and greenhouse gases with the atmosphere. It is considered to be one of just 54 key variables used to characterise the Earth climate system.Sacha explains her reason for taking part in the competition: “My day job involves conveying scientific information that is easily understood and engaging for the general public. The competition gave me an opportunity to try visualising the same data that are being used to understand the Earth system and inform decision-making to protect humanity’s future.” Winning Little Picture showcased at COP28 A picture paints a thousand wordsThe competition attracted close to 500 entries on the run up to COP28, with the quality of Little Pictures submitted being very high. The results were judged by representatives of each organisation plus leading data journalist Matthias Stahl of Der Spiegel newspaper and Professor Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading - the creator of the famous Show Your Stripes visualisation.“The range of climate variables that were chosen to be visualised was particularly striking,” notes Prof Hawkins, who adds, “This could be a reflection the growing suite of observation datasets now available but also growing public consciousness of the impacts climate change that are affecting every region on Earth, in multiple ways.”Showcase of climate impacts Of the 10 runners up, the visualisations incorporated data on rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels; the knock-on upward global monthly temperature trend between 1940-2023, illustrated by Neil Kaye, climate data scientist at the UK’s Met Office using ECMWF’s ERA5 reanalysis data.Other competition entries focussed on the long-term impacts of a warming world.

With these measurements paramount for nations assessing the action they are taking to combat the climate crisis, new research shows how differences in estimates of carbon flux associated with human activity can be reconciled. The research, published recently in the Carbon Balance and Management journal, describes why there can be a gap between carbon flux estimates based on data from Earth observing satellites and country estimates given in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.Net forest carbon flux is the net exchange of carbon between forests and the atmosphere, calculated as the balance between carbon emitted and carbon sequestered by forests, per hectare over a given period.Satellites provide independent information to show how forests change over time, which allows rates of carbon flux to be estimated. These measurements can then be compared to results reported in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.However, this approach can throw up discrepancies. Brazilian forest carbon flux 2001–2020 The published paper highlights the example of Brazil where estimates using Earth observation data indicated that, between 2001 and 2020, the country as a whole was as a net carbon sink. This contrasts to the country’s inventory, which showed that human activity resulted in forests in Brazil being a net carbon source.A carbon source releases more carbon than it absorbs, from activities such as deforestation, logging and fire. A carbon sink is a reservoir that absorbs more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases owing to the ongoing growth of standing forests and the restoration of new forests.Viola Heinrich, from the University of Bristol and the German Research Centre for Geoscience, and lead author of the paper, said, “A key reason why there can be discrepancies between datasets derived from satellites compared to what is reported in inventories can be linked to whether or not a piece of land is considered as managed by humans. “National reports can define an area of forest as managed, but satellites cannot distinguish whether they are managed or natural.“When we adjust Earth observation datasets to land declared as managed in the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, the estimates can then align.The research team focused on three countries as case studies: Brazil as the primary case study, Indonesia and Malaysia.After adjusting the satellite estimates to use the Brazilian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory’s definition of managed forest and other assumptions in the inventory''s methodology, the Earth observation net flux became a source of +0.6 Gt of carbon dioxide per year, which is comparable to that stated in the inventory. Tropical forest in Brazil - Click to zoom in In Indonesia, the satellite dataset and the inventory net flux estimates were similar: a source of +0.6 Gt of carbon dioxide per year.However, in Malaysia, there was a considerable difference. The inventory stating that at –0.2 Gt carbon dioxide a year their forests were a sink, but the satellite data indicated that the forests were a source of +0.2 Gt carbon dioxide a year.Dr Heinrich continued, “Despite limited spatial data available for Indonesia and Malaysia, our comparison indicated specific aspects where differing approaches may explain divergence, including uncertainties and inaccuracies“Moreover, our study highlights the importance of enhanced transparency, as set out by the Paris Agreement, to enable alignment between different approaches for independent measuring and verification.” ESA’s Clement Albergel added, “This research has very important implications for our ESA Climate Change Initiative Regional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes Phase-2 (RECCAP-2) project.“The project supports and accelerates the analysis of regional carbon budgets based on the results of top-down atmospheric inversion as well as bottom-up data-driven models and process-oriented global dynamic vegetation models. Bottom-up inventories only report fluxes on managed lands, so, inversions have to be sampled over managed lands.“Using a similar approach as outlined in the recent published paper, will now be able to better reconcile top-down inversions and National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.” Editor’s noteThree different approaches can be used to monitor GHG budgets: 1. Top-down estimates from atmospheric inversions based on atmospheric GHG measurements from in-situ monitoring networks or satellites with atmospheric transport models. 2. Bottom-up approaches based on process-based or bookkeeping models for natural and anthropogenic fluxes.3. Bottom-up approaches using activity statistics combined with emission factors, or empirical or process-based modelling.The first two approaches are used in global greenhouse gas budgets by the Global Carbon Project, while most National Greenhouse Gas Inventories follow the third type of bottom-up approach, with different levels of details based on different Tiers defined by IPCC guidelines.

Ice sheets are shrinking, sea levels are rising and coral reefs are dying off.While climate records are being continuously broken, the cumulative impact of these changes could also cause fundamental parts of the Earth system to change dramatically. These ‘tipping points’ of climate change are critical thresholds in that, if exceeded, can lead to irreversible consequences. What are climate tipping points?According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), tipping points are ‘critical thresholds in a system that, when exceeded, can lead to a significant change in the state of the system, often with an understanding that the change is irreversible.’In essence, climate tipping points are elements of the Earth system in which small changes can kick off reinforcing loops that ‘tip’ a system from one stable state into a profoundly different state.For example, a rise in global temperatures because of fossil fuel burning, further down the line, triggers a change like a rainforest becoming a dry savannah. This change is propelled by self-perpetuating feedback loops, even if what was driving the change in the system stops. The system – in this case the forest – may remain ‘tipped’ even if the temperature falls below the threshold again.This shift from one state to the other may take decades or even centuries to find a new, stable state. But if tipping points are being crossed now, or within the next decade, their full impact might not become apparent for hundreds or thousands of years. How do climate tipping points work? Access the video On top of that, the crossing of one tipping point could lead to the triggering of further tipping elements – unleashing a domino-effect chain reaction and could lead to some places becoming less suitable for sustaining human and natural systems.For example: the Arctic is warming almost four times faster than anywhere else in the world, accelerating ice melt from the Greenland Ice Sheet (and the melting of Arctic sea ice).This in turn could be what is slowing down the ocean’s circulation of heat, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), in turn impacting the monsoon system over South America. Monsoon changes may be contributing to the rising frequency of droughts over the Amazon rainforest, lowering its carbon storage capacity and intensifying climate warming.The impacts of such a ‘tipping cascade,’ crossing multiple climate tipping points, could be more severe and widespread.Climate tipping elementsIn the early 2000s, a range of tipping elements were first identified and were thought that they would be reached in the event of a 4°C increase in global temperatures. Since then, science has advanced tremendously and there have been many studies on tipping-point behaviour and interactions among tipping-element systems.These elements broadly fall into three categories — cryosphere, ocean-atmosphere, and biosphere — and range from the melting of the Greenland ice sheet to the death of coral reefs.According to the newly-published Global Tipping Points Report, five major tipping systems are already at risk of crossing tipping points at the present level of global warming: the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, permafrost regions, coral reef die-offs and the Labrador Sea and subpolar gyre circulation.Click on the infographic below to learn more about each climate tipping point. Climate tipping points in Earth’s climate system What can satellites reveal about climate tipping points?Our planet has already warmed by roughly 1.2°C since the Industrial Revolution and current pledges under the Paris Agreement put us on track to increase that to 2.5–2.9°C temperature rise this century. Recent assessments found that even exceeding 1.5°C of global warming risks crossing several of these thresholds for tipping points.Earth observation plays a crucial role in monitoring and understanding climate tipping points by providing a comprehensive view of the Earth''s systems. Satellites orbiting our planet enable scientists to track changes in polar ice sheets, and their glaciers and ice shelves, deforestation rates, ocean temperatures and other key indicators.For instance, satellites such as ESA’s CryoSat and Copernicus Sentinel-1 can measure changes in ice volume and flow. Satellites that provide information on gravity can work out how much ice is being lost in polar regions, helping to identify potential tipping points in ice sheet stability and the pace of their response to climate change. Optical satellites like Sentinel-2 contribute to monitoring changes in land cover or vegetation, such as the expansion or decline of critical ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest.ESA’s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite and the upcoming Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) mission contribute to monitoring soil moisture and vegetation health. These missions can aid in understanding changes in terrestrial ecosystems and their resilience to climate impacts.In the context of ocean circulation patterns, satellites like Sentinel-3 and SMOS contribute to monitoring sea surface temperatures, currents, ocean colour and sea surface salinity, providing insights into the strength and dynamics of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.By capturing a wide spectrum of data, satellites provide essential information for early detection of environmental shifts, enhancing our understanding of these complex phenomena and aiding in developing effective strategies for climate mitigation and adaptation.

Airbus Defence and Space, who is building six of the Galileo Second Generation constellation satellites, presented their first flight model structure to the programme’s stakeholders last week. With 28 satellites in orbit and 10 more ready to be launched, Europe’s Galileo is the world’s most precise satellite navigation system. It is used by more than four billion users around the world, who can determine their position at metre-level accuracy.But Galileo is not stopping here: its Second Generation (G2) is poised to transform the fleet, introducing an array of advanced functionalities and capabilities. "G2 will take our high-performing navigation system into the future with novel services and additional robustness," declares ESA’s Head of Galileo Space Segment Management Office, Andrea Cotellessa.To make the future of Galileo a reality, ESA and European industry are hard at work developing ultra-precise atomic clocks, system testbeds, ground mission and ground control segments and, of course, the satellites that will make up the constellation. Airbus Defence and Space (DE) and Thales Alenia Space (IT) are building six satellites each that together will form the first G2 fleet. G2 satellite structure Galileo Second Generation satellites will be groundbreaking: “they will have fully digital payloads, use electric propulsion, host a more powerful navigation antenna, and carry more and even better atomic clocks on board,” explains ESA''s Galileo Second Generation Project Manager Miguel Manteiga Bautista. “The modular architecture will offer a high degree of flexibility to accommodate more equipment and inter-satellite links will be enabled,” he adds.This innovative design is possible thanks to the dedication of European industry and ESA, who redefine the boundaries of satellite navigation by continuously developing and testing new technologies. In fact, most innovations on G2 satellites stem from R&D programmes like the Agency’s GNSS Evolution Programme and the EU’s Horizon 2020. Navigation payload and antenna, check Galileo Second Generation antenna One of the most innovative elements in the Airbus Defence and Space G2 satellite is the navigation antenna, which was validated after undergoing an intensive radiated performance test at the Spanish National Institute of Aerospace Technology (INTA) this summer.The navigation payload - the satellite’s heart and brain – was assessed at the company''s facilities in Ottobrunn, Germany. A model of the payload demonstrated its capacity to amplify and radiate navigation signals as expected.“After the successful design phase we are now kicking off production in earnest of the state-of-the-art Galileo G2 satellites. Our teams in Friedrichshafen are working with engineers across Europe to meet the challenging schedule and finalise these sophisticated satellites which will further improve the global Galileo system opening up even more opportunities for services on Earth,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Airbus Space Systems at Airbus Defence and Space. Flight model satellite structure, check The G2 satellite structure manufactured by the Swiss branch of Beyond Gravity was presented last week to programme stakeholders at Airbus Defence and Space''s site in Friedrichshafen, Germany. “The team demonstrated how the immense panels that form the satellite’s structure will be disassembled and prepared for delivery to the various Airbus sites,” explained Eric Villette, ESA’s Head of Management Office for Airbus Defence and Space G2 Satellite.The company is reusing a time-tried modular design created for telecommunication satellites. The different units are assembled around a central tube and supported by an outside frame, forming a cube that measures 3 by 3 meters. In the coming months, the structure will be disassembled and equipped with the harness (the intricate network of wires needed to power and connect the satellite’s components) and the thermal hardware (the system that regulates the satellite’s temperature). Then it will be populated with units, tested for functional and environment verification, and finally qualified for launch.“The milestones in the development of Galileo Second Generation keep piling up. I cannot wait to see the many parts come together to bring to life an even better performing Galileo system, so this EU programme can continue serving European and world citizens,” says ESA''s Director of Navigation Javier Benedicto. About Galileo Galileo is currently the world’s most precise satellite navigation system, serving close to four billion users around the globe since entering Open Service in 2017. All smartphones sold in the European Single Market are now guaranteed Galileo-enabled. In addition, Galileo is making a difference across the fields of rail, maritime, agriculture, financial timing services and rescue operations.Galileo is a flagship programme of the European Union, managed and funded by the European Commission. Since its inception, ESA leads the design, development and qualification of the space and ground systems, as well as procuring launches.

UNEP is the global programme of the United Nations (UN) and the leading global voice on the environment. It provides leadership and encourages partnership in caring for the environment by inspiring, informing and enabling nations and people to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations.UNEP’s dedication to global environmental issues, combined with ESA’s expertise in satellite technology and Earth observation, forges a strong alliance to shape a sustainable future for both our planet and society.The new collaboration will leverage space-based solutions to address pressing environmental challenges, from climate change and environmental protection to pollution monitoring and disaster risk reduction.The partnership will facilitate the co-development of innovative Earth observation solutions tackling high-priority topics such as the sustainable Green Transition, ecosystem accounting, nature capital valuation and early warning systems for the environment.The collaboration also addresses interoperability aspects, including the integration of data from ESA’s Earth Explorer missions, Copernicus Sentinel satellites, together with ESA science and applications results onto UNEP’s platforms, such as the World Environment Situation Room.ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, commented, “The collaboration between ESA and UNEP comes at a critical juncture when the world is grappling with the adverse impacts of climate change. Space technology offers a unique vantage point, providing comprehensive and real-time data crucial for informed decision-making.“By combining forces, ESA and UNEP are poised to provide invaluable insights to policymakers, governments, and organisations, enabling them to formulate effective strategies for environmental conservation and sustainable development.” Josef Aschbacher, ESA Director General, and Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding at COP28. The memorandum creates the perfect synergy to respond to the ambitious goals set by the historical international adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) in December 2022. The GBF sets the pathway to reach the global vision of a world living in harmony with nature by 2050, and in full support to achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, said, “The partnership between UNEP and ESA will strengthen UNEP’s capacity to deliver science-based, data-driven early warning systems for the environment.“With ESA''s innovative geospatial and space technologies, we can support more accurate policymaking, prevent social and economic losses, and boost the use of digital technologies to develop innovative solutions to address the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution. This can offer particular hope in addressing plastic pollution and implementing the Global Biodiversity Framework.”The memorandum also compliments ESA’s partnerships with other UN bodies like Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and will pave the way for ESA’s Space for a Green Future Accelerator.The accelerator, one of ESA’s Accelerators driving Europe’s innovation and the use of space to the global climate crisis, aims to develop practical space-based solutions to support carbon neutrality and the greening of society by 2050.Josef Aschbacher, ESA Director General, said, “ESA and UNEP share a common purpose and mission – to ensure a sustainable future for our planet. Past collaboration between our organisations has led to many fruitful developments and opportunities. Building on this long-standing cooperation, we aim to accelerate the use of space and Earth observation data and digital technology to achieve this common purpose and mission.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

With satellites fundamental to understanding and monitoring climate change, ESA has awarded a contract to Airbus to take the TRUTHS satellite mission to its next development phase.TRUTHS is set to provide the gold reference for climate measurements, thereby giving decision-makers more confidence in the data they use for climate action. ESA goes to great lengths to ensure that the data beaming back to Earth from satellites are as reliable as possible. But how can we be sure that measurements from space are truly accurate, especially when it comes to the all-important data needed to act on climate change?The Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial- and Helio-Studies mission, or TRUTHS for short, will lay any such doubts to rest.ESA is building this new satellite under the umbrella of its Earth Watch programme on behalf of the UK and other five ESA Member States, Switzerland, Czechia, Spain, Greece and Romania.It will provide traceable International System of Units (SI) measurements of incoming solar radiation and of radiation reflected from Earth back out into space, with which to calibrate data from other satellites and to provide high-accuracy Earth’s radiation data to climate modelling scientists. TRUTHS for reference climate measurements In effect, TRUTHS will be a ‘standards laboratory in space’, setting the gold standard reference for climate measurements.With liftoff slated for 2030, ESA is in the process of developing this novel satellite, a process that is done in careful stages – the latest of which is marked by the signing of a contract at the COP28 summit to take the mission into a phase that focuses on the design of the satellite and its instruments involving building demonstration models of some of the key technologies.This next step also includes analysing the instruments’ performance, which includes exhaustive simulations and system modelling, to demonstrate their technical maturity.ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, said, “We are glad to award the contract to Airbus in the UK to take their work on developing TRUTHS into the next all-important phase. We see here at COP28 that the world is committed to climate action and having reliable data on which to base decisions is of the utmost importance.“TRUTHS will be used as a benchmark to so that data from other satellites can be compared more easily, thereby improving reliability.”Jean Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus, added, “This contract takes us one step closer to building a mission that will enable scientists and climatologists to cross reference their measurements and data enabling much more accurate forecasts and analysis in a shorter time.” TRUTHS contract signature at COP28 The TRUTHS satellite will host two main instruments: the Cryogenic Solar Absolute Radiometer and the Hyperspectral Imaging Spectrometer as well as the novel onboard calibration system.Together, these instruments will make continuous measurements of both incoming and Earth reflected solar radiation. These two observations will be used to evaluate the Earth’s energy-in to energy-out ratio.Essentially, the amount of incoming solar energy compared to the amount that bounces back to space controls our climate. An accurate knowledge of these energy exchanges is fundamental to understanding and monitoring change.ESA also signed a contract today with Teledyne e2v to develop the detection system, which is at the core of TRUTHS’ Hyperspectral Imaging Spectrometer.

Swift and sustained climate action is needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Satellites are critical tools in the quest to tackle climate change and monitor progress towards a lower-emissions and more resilient world. Taking stock of global climate actionNearly 200 countries agreed under the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2°C above preindustrial times and to aim for 1.5°C to avoid the most severe and irreversible impacts of climate change.The global stocktake will evaluate the world’s collective progress towards the mitigation and adaptation and identify gaps to achieve the Paris Agreement as well as opportunities to bridge them. Its initial key findings, published in September, revealed just how far the world is from achieving the Paris Agreement’s goals and emphasises the closing window of opportunity.It stresses the need for stronger climate action before the next global stocktake in 2028 or we may witness the devastating reality of global temperatures surpassing the 1.5°C mark.The first-ever assessment, or ‘stocktake,’ will conclude during this year’s UN Climate Change Conference (COP28) taking place in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. By the end of COP28, countries must agree on how they will leverage the stocktake’s findings to keep the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5°C and address the impacts of climate change.If undertaken effectively, the global stocktake can provide an opportunity to leverage decisions and accelerate ambition in climate action plans. ESA Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, comments, “The global stocktake is a moment of truth. We know that currently we are not on track to limit global warming and the window to act is closing."Satellites provide us with a systematic, global and continuous coverage of our planet, including the areas most difficult to reach. We cannot manage what we cannot measure: satellite observations provide early warnings of change, they improve climate predictions and deliver the hard facts needed for effective international climate action.” Accurate reportingFor this process to be robust, accurate and consistent reporting is needed at a national scale. Currently, national greenhouse gas emissions inventories, which are reported to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are compiled using emissions factors and national statistics.To enhance accuracy, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) encourages countries to verify reported emissions against independent measurements, such as Earth observation data, to promote transparency and align emissions reporting with real-world conditions.Research from ESA’s Regional Carbon Assessment and Processes project (RECCAP-2) developed and implemented a comprehensive framework to compare national inventories against state-of-the-art systems making use of satellite observations.The project researchers combine satellite-derived observations and in situ measurements with inversion models that help to factor the ‘flux’ or movement of greenhouse gas emissions between land and atmosphere, to backtrack greenhouse gas concentrations to their origin.This top-down approach offers a full picture of the emissions that accumulate in the atmosphere at the country scale. This is then used to check national inventories to enhance greenhouse gas reporting. RECAPP-2: analysing carbon budgets It can help reduce uncertainties in national greenhouse gas inventories, identify additional emissions reduction opportunities and provide nations with timely guidance on progress towards their emission reduction strategies and pledges.Currently, only large, high-emitting countries can be assessed. But with denser satellite sampling anticipated in the coming years, more countries are set to benefit.Building on similar research methods, ESA is developing World Emission – an emissions-monitoring service that leverages satellite data from Copernicus, from space agencies such as NASA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and complementary ground-based measurements.This unique global coverage project will generate maps for carbon dioxide, methane and several atmospheric pollutants. It will provide essential information for policymakers, governments, national reporting agencies and subsidiary bodies to enhance pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions inventories.This is just one example of how Earth observation can demonstrate its uniqueness and excellence to complement traditional information, contributing significantly to the overall drive for climate change mitigation.New mission to detect humanmade emissionsOn top of the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite, new satellite missions launched in the coming years will provide a much denser sampling of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane. ESA is developing the Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring (CO2M) mission – the first satellite mission to measure how much carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere specifically through human activity.By providing a unique and independent source of information, CO2M will be key to assessing the effectiveness of policies aimed at curbing emissions at both national and global scale, enabling countries to track and show how they are progressing against their decarbonisation commitments.The mission is anticipated to provide data to support the second global stocktake that will conclude in 2028, as well as the dramatic decarbonisation of Europe’s economised needed to deliver the EU Green Deal.

Testing in the field provides a unique opportunity to complement laboratory tests, verifying the system’s performance from a user perspective in a more dynamic and realistic setting. Navigation and telecommunications testbed vehicle The four wheel-drive vehicles can host a three-person team and are crammed with dedicated navigation and telecommunications monitoring equipment: satellite navigation receivers, antennas that range from the most sophisticated to mass market grade, interference monitoring equipment, antijamming antennas and other interference mitigation systems.An inertial navigation system on board serves as the ‘source of truth’, an independent relative positioning reference to compare readings from the receivers to the actual position of the vehicle. Special batteries to power instruments, as well as plenty of radiofrequency equipment and battery back-ups are also needed during test campaigns.The vans are based at the European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), ESA’s technical heart in Noordwijk, the Netherlands and are usually driven around South Holland, both in rural areas and in more challenging urban environments like the heart of Rotterdam. But they can operate anywhere in Europe and have crossed Dutch borders to join international test campaigns like Jammertest in the north of Norway. Jammertest 2023 The current mobile testbeds were procured at the same time as ESA was developing the Galileo programme. It was a priority for the team that the system performed well in ‘real-world’ environments and not only in controlled laboratory conditions, for which field testing was a must.One of the vehicles hosted the first outdoor Galileo position fix. While most of the team witnessed the first fix from ESA’s Nav Lab, a group of engineers drove the van around the ESTEC complex and were able to confirm Galileo worked as planned from a mobile platform.Before procuring the vehicles, a team of ESA radionavigation engineers tested the concept: they installed limited equipment on the rear seat of an old minivan and explored routes around ESTEC while testing GPS signal. A receiver on board this vehicle was also able to locate its position in the streets of Leiden on the day of Galileo’s first fix. ESA radionavigation engineer Over the past ten years, the Agency’s navigation and telecommunications testbed vehicles have been crucial in monitoring Galileo’s performance and providing feedback about its services to the design team, feeding the continuous improvement cycle and ensuring the system actually responds to user needs as defined by its service provider, the EU Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) and the European Commission, who manages and funds Galileo. Commercial equipment such as mass-market receiver chips, including products developed within ESA’s NAVISP programme, have also been tested in these vans. Thanks to the data gathered by these mobile laboratories, together with the information collected by the broader Galileo performance monitoring system and the feedback provided by the users via EUSPA, Galileo Second Generation will be able to offer even more accurate positioning, navigation and timing services and revolutionise satellite navigation.

But how will it do that exactly? Clouds remain one of the biggest uncertainties in how the atmosphere drives the climate system. A better understanding of the relationship between clouds, aerosols and radiation is a high priority in both climate research and weather prediction.For example, what happens to infrared radiation when emitted from Earth’s surface and trapped by clouds? What role do aerosols play in reflecting solar radiation back to space? And how do these processes affect climate and weather?The Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission will provide novel observations to answer some of these critical scientific questions. EarthCARE is equipped with four state-of-the-art instruments, each designed to provide unique insights into the complex interactions between clouds, aerosols and radiation. Atmospheric lidarThe atmospheric lidar is an advanced lidar (light detection and ranging) system designed to measure the vertical profile of aerosols and clouds in Earth’s atmosphere along the EarthCARE track. By emitting light pulses and analysing the reflected signals, this unique lidar can precisely provide the distribution and properties of aerosols and clouds, including their altitude, thickness and detailed optical properties and aerosol type. This information is crucial for improving climate models and understanding the role of aerosols and clouds in Earth’s energy balance.Cloud profiling radar Provided by the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA), the cloud profiling radar is a key instrument that enables EarthCARE to observe the internal structure of clouds. Operating in the millimetre-wavelength range, the cloud profiling radar penetrates through clouds and light precipitation – providing detailed insights into their vertical structure and velocity, particle size distribution and water content. This radar is essential for studying cloud processes, such as the formation and dissipation of clouds, and contributes valuable data for improving weather and climate models.Multispectral imagerWhereas the lidar and radar will provide profiles of the atmosphere in a rather thin curtain, directly underneath the satellite, EarthCARE’s multispectral imager provides a much wide field of view to give context to the profile measurements.The multispectral imager captures high-resolution images in multiple spectral bands in the visible and infrared spectrum, which will allow scientists to differentiate between various types of clouds, aerosols and Earth’s surface.The imager provides additional information about the optical properties of clouds and aerosols, aiding in the characterisation of their composition and distribution. In addition, it will allow the generation of a three-dimensional cloud and aerosol field using the atmospheric lidar and cloud profiling radar data. These data are crucial for understanding the radiative impact of clouds and aerosols on Earth’s climate system.Broadband radiometer The broadband radiometer plays a crucial role in EarthCARE''s mission by measuring the radiative fluxes at the top of Earth''s atmosphere. As the satellite travels along its orbit, the radiometer views the atmosphere from three directions, allowing it to accurately quantify the amount of reflected solar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation emitted by Earth.This is known as the planet''s energy balance. Comparing this to the radiation calculated from the combined observations of the other instruments will help scientists improve our current understanding of the aerosol-cloud-radiation interaction. Together, these four instruments form a powerful suite of tools that provide unprecedented observations of Earth''s atmosphere. The data generated by EarthCARE''s instruments contribute significantly to advancing our knowledge of climate processes and will unravel the intricate interactions between clouds, aerosols and radiation in Earth''s atmosphere. Kotska Wallace, EarthCARE’s Mission and Optical Payload Manager, explains how the satellite''s unique set of four instruments provide a complete view of the interplay between clouds, aerosols and radiation.

The mission comes at a critical time in the development of kilometre-scale resolution, global climate models and will provide an important contribution to an improved understanding of cloud convection and its role in Earth’s radiation budget.EarthCARE is an ESA mission, but it has been developed as a cooperation between ESA and JAXA, the Japanese Space Agency.As the international science community eagerly awaits the valuable data from the EarthCARE satellite, researchers and experts from the field gathered at ESA’s Centre for Earth Observation in Frascati, Italy, to present and discuss EarthCARE science topics and validation of the mission data.As EarthCARE''s launch approaches, the growing excitement is being felt across the community. The central role of the mission in ensuring long-term, climate-relevant datasets, in synergy with past and future missions, was also clearly identified.

ESA has awarded a development contract to advanced networking and laser communications company Aalyria, to build a software platform that will harness the power of these assets to support 5G/6G connectivity. Aalyria''s Spacetime modeling a multi-orbit network constellation The project aims to build 5G/6G compatibility into Aalyria’s Spacetime system; a software platform that can bring together a wide range of systems to form networks that cover space, air, sea and land. Unlike fixed-position assets on Earth, those operating in the atmosphere and in space are in constant motion relative to our planet, to each other and to potential users. Bringing them together has been challenging in the past, as it has relied on bespoke systems that are not designed for interoperability. Antonio Franchi, Head of Space for 5G and 6G Strategic Programme at ESA, said: “Collaborations with industrial partners, like this one with Aalyria, play a pivotal role in ESA''s efforts to advance the digital transformation of industry and society, thanks to the integration of 5G/6G terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. Establishing seamless, ubiquitous and resilient connectivity is vital in the context of emerging technologies. The platform envisioned under this development contract could be a game-changing asset for telecommunications systems, with substantial benefits for stakeholders.”Chris Taylor, Aalyria CEO, said: "This achievement marks a significant milestone in Aalyria''s journey towards reshaping the future of space communications.

The research, published today in Nature Communications, describes how a team of scientists from the University of Leeds, Lancaster University, ENVEO, the University of Delaware and the British Antarctic Survey, used data from nine different satellite missions, including ESA’s CryoSat and Europe’s Copernicus Sentinel-1, along with in-situ measurements to map how the floating ice shelf and glacier changed.They found that between November 2018 and May 2021, the glacier retreated a whopping eight kilometres, after being stable for around 50 years.They conclude that unusually high ocean water temperatures around the west Antarctic Peninsula in 2018–2019 have triggered the Cadman Glacier system to change dramatically. $(window).load(function() { $(".twentytwenty-container").twentytwenty({ default_offset_pct: 0.5, orientation: ''horizontal'', before_label: "2017", after_label: "2023", set_container_height: true, move_slider_on_hover: false, move_with_handle_only: true, click_to_move: false });}); The changing face of Cadman Ice Shelf Open Image Benjamin Wallis, from the University of Leeds who led the research, explained, “By tracking Cadman Glacier with satellites we saw that it started speeding up massively in 2018, and when we investigated ocean reanalysis data, we found that the waters nearby were up to 2°C warmer than average at that time.“We think the warmer waters gradually started to eat away at the Cadman Ice Shelf from the early 2000s, but possibly from as early as the 1970s.“The warmer water was not only on the surface of the ocean, but also deep in the water column. This warmer water may have reached to where the shelf was grounded on the sea floor. The result being that the ice shelf was melting from the bottom up, which we were able to observe using satellite data.”Extending from glaciers on land, ice shelves float on the ocean surface and sometime reach the ocean floor where then can be anchored, or grounded.Importantly, ice shelves act as a buttress, slowing the flow of the glacier towards the sea. Marine-terminating glacier The Cadman Ice Shelf became so thin that it was no longer able to hold back the glacier.In 2019, the shelf broke free from the grounding zone, in effect slipping anchor and enabling the Cadman Glacier to speed up and drain more ice into the sea.According to this new research, the Cadman Glacier is now in a state of ‘substantial dynamic imbalance’.The ice on the glacier has continued to thin, losing 20 metres a year in height, which is equivalent to a loss in height of a five-storey building each year. And around 2.16 billion tonnes of ice are draining from the Cadman Glacier into the ocean each year. “Curiously, neighbouring glaciers on this part of the west Antarctic Peninsula did not react in the same way, which may hold important lessons for the way we can better project how climate change will continue to affect this important and sensitive polar region,” noted Benjamin Wallis.The researchers say what has happened to the Cadman Glacier can be seen as an example of a ‘glaciological tipping point’, where a system in a steady state can take one or two paths based on a change in an environmental parameter. A tipping point was reached in 2018 caused by the arrival of unusually warm ocean water, which caused the ice shelf to unground. Reaching this tipping point caused Cadman Glacier to increase its ice discharge by 28% in 13 months. Prof. Michael Meredith, from the British Antarctic Survey and one of the authors of the paper, said, “We have known for some time that the ocean around Antarctica is heating up rapidly, and that this poses a significant threat to glaciers and the ice sheet, with consequences for sea-level rise globally.“What this new research shows is that apparently stable glaciers can switch very rapidly, becoming unstable almost without warning, and then thinning and retreating very strongly. CRISTAL “This emphasises the need for a comprehensive ocean observing network around Antarctica, especially in regions close to glaciers that are especially hard to make measurements.” ESA’s Mark Drinkwater added, “Again we see that the Antarctic is more susceptible to change than we thought a few years ago. It is imperative that we continue to monitor this fragile continent and surrounding oceans. We can only capture the full extent of such changes with pan-Antarctic measurements obtained by satellites over decades.“Thankfully, we have missions such as CryoSat and Copernicus Sentinel-1 in orbit, but, importantly, we are developing new satellite missions such as the Copernicus Sentinel Expansion Mission Cristal and Sentinel-1 Next Generation to continue, to sustain, and enhance these types of measurements in the future.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Held at the European Satellite Centre in Madrid, Spain, the ‘Space Data Space’ workshop - led by ESA in partnership with the European Space Policy Institute - explored how partners can store and share space data. This is particularly valuable during times of crisis, especially when combined with airborne and ground-based data, or detailed information about critical infrastructure, for example.ESA’s Pascal Legai, Senior Security Advisor to the Director General of ESA, opened the workshop by giving the floor to the Director of the European Satellite Centre, Ambassador Sorin Ducaru.One of the keynote speakers, Alberto Palomo, Chief Data Officer of the Government of Spain, said: “Data per se is not valuable, it becomes so only if you transform it and make actual use of it.” Christopher Topping, ESA’s Civil Security from Space Programme Manager, giving a keynote presentation at the Space Data Space workshop Giving another keynote presentation, Christopher Topping, ESA’s Civil Security from Space Programme Manager, said: “The access to information, swiftly, anywhere at any time is imperative in times of urgent action. We are all too familiar with the natural disasters, the geopolitical instabilities and the impact they have on people, state and critical assets. We need responsive availability to actionable information, we need it through the lifecycle of incidents, to reduce its impact by preventive measures, to reacting to unfolding events, and to the recovery phase.” Artists impression of a synthetic aperture radar satellite over a wildfire To help achieve this, ESA is developing the necessary solutions through the Civil Security from Space Programme, which will use space assets to help save lives and livelihoods.One example is the recent partnership signed with ICEYE, a Finnish microsatellite manufacturer and data and solutions provider, which will improve early warning systems for floods and wildfires globally. ICEYE’s satellites use synthetic aperture radar technology to see through smoke and storm clouds, allowing emergency teams to assess the risks of fires and storm-related flooding by providing data in near-real time. ESA is seeking to partner with many satellite providers. For example, Open Cosmos, a UK-based ESA Business Incubation Centre start-up company that provides the tools necessary for businesses, research institutions and other organisations to develop, launch and operate satellites. The collaboration aims to foster the sharing of satellites’ capabilities and data resources to better meet the urgent needs of civil security and crisis responders during disaster.Collaborations such as these enhance the use and integration of space technologies to support a quick response to crises on Earth, contributing to the ESA Rapid and Resilient Crisis Response Accelerator.

ESA hosted last week its annual NAVISP Industry Days event. This year, more than 200 positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) professionals from across Europe gathered at ESA’s Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in the Netherlands to explore together opportunities for innovation, commercialisation and collaboration via ESA’s Navigation Innovation and Support Programme (NAVISP).“We are in front of a revolution: satellite navigation is the largest downstream revenue market. We have a huge responsibility in supporting European leadership to unlock its enormous potential for society and economy,” stated Pierluigi Mancini, Head of NAVISP Programme, during the opening speech. The event highlighted the critical importance of PNT across market areas. On the first day, a session on mobility saw representatives from automotive, rail and maritime sectors break down silos and identify common challenges. The afternoon session focused on alternative technologies such as 5G and eLoran and how they can contribute to making satellite navigation more resilient.On the second day, panellists discussed the latest trends in the field, with an emphasis on sensor fusion and combination of technologies. Speakers talked about the integration of Artificial Intelligence in GNSS receivers and map development, improvements brought by quantum computing, mainstream demand for high accuracy and a multilayer approach to navigation, with low Earth orbit and enhanced technologies on the ground making satnav signals stronger, faster to acquire and more reliable. Session on positioning, navigation and timing trends Innovation does not only apply to techniques and technologies; speakers also presented novel applications of satellite navigation, for example under-ice oceanographic exploration for climate change monitoring or protection of critical underwater infrastructure such as submarine networks and offshore wind farms.With support from the NAVISP programme, the European industry is already working on these innovations to materialise them in the next three to five years. Broadening the network While the sessions provided fascinating insights, participants underscored the value of networking. “The need to collaborate is also a driving force for innovation: during conversations I had with other participants new ideas arose. Our companies will hugely benefit from this experience,” one of the attendees said. “The event has been extremely successful in my view: I learned a lot and met many people I hope to be talking to in the future,” remarked another participant.The event also provided a platform for PNT players to learn about the opportunities offered by NAVISP’s three elements: Innovation, Competitiveness and Support to Member States and their national strategies. Networking break “We are delighted to see many industries attended NAVISP Industry Days for the first time this year, from aviation and urban air mobility to geomatics and agriculture. It is an excellent opportunity for us to assess if the programme is meeting the needs of an evolving and highly competitive market,” said Luis Mayo, Chair of the NAVISP Advisory Committee.Indeed, NAVISP’s flagship event is crucial to shaping the programme and making sure it supports European leadership in navigation: “NAVISP is not a programme built by ESA, but built by you: participants, companies, delegations. Public money needs to be used as a catalyst, supporting pilot projects and innovation that can afterwards attract private investment,” concluded Head of NAVISP Technical Programme Office Rafael Lucas Rodríguez.The presentations from this year’s NAVISP Industry Days can be found here. The next edition is planned for spring 2025. About NAVISP ESA navigation specialists are supporting cutting-edge European companies in the development of new PNT technologies and services – in support of Europe''s industrial competitiveness, autonomy and leadership. The result is ESA’s Navigation Innovation and Support Programme, NAVISP.NAVISP is looking into all kinds of clever ideas about the future of satellite navigation and positioning, navigation and timing: ways to improve satellite navigation, alternative positioning systems and new navigation services and applications.For more information, visit the NAVISP webpage.

We will then go through the procedure of selecting one mission to be implemented as Earth Explorer 11 in 2025, with a view to launching the successful mission in the 2032–33 timeframe.”ESA''s Earth Explorers, which are developed within the FutureEO programme, investigate various aspects of Earth''s environment.The two Earth Explorer 11 mission concepts promise to build on the success of missions that provide or are set to provide vital data for scientific research. Earth Explorer 11 candidate mission Cairt Cairt – short for changing-atmosphere infrared tomography – would provide the measurements needed to make a necessary step change in understanding the links between climate change, atmospheric chemistry and dynamics in the altitude range of about 5 to 115 km.It would focus on the processes that couple atmospheric circulation, composition and regional climate change, providing critical observations not available from existing or planned satellite missions.Cairt would be the first limb-sounder with imaging Fourier-transform infrared technology in space.Wivern – short for wind velocity radar nephoscope – would provide the first measurements of wind within clouds and precipitation. There is a notable gap in global observations of wind in cloudy regions. The mission would also deliver profiles of rain, snow and ice water. Earth Explorer 11 candidate mission Wivern Carrying a dual-polarisation, conically scanning, 94 GHz Doppler radar with an 800 km swath, the mission would improve forecasts of hazardous weather and provide new insights into severe storms.It would also contribute to the climate record of cloud and precipitation profiling.The time invested into assessing the two missions that were not selected, Seastar and Nitrosat, has not been wasted. Rune Floberghagen, Head of ESA’s Climate Action, Sustainability and Science Department, noted, “All meticulous activities on these two missions have helped to establish ground-breaking concepts and scientific foundations, by pioneering new observations that at some point in future would unlock insights into coastal ocean dynamics and the nitrogen cycle.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Now complete, this remarkable microsatellite has been shipped from OHB in Sweden to Germany where it is starting a series of tests to make sure that it will survive liftoff next year and its subsequent life in orbit. As its name suggests, the new Arctic Weather Satellite mission is expected to improve weather forecasts in the Arctic – a region that currently lacks data for accurate short-term forecasts.Today, satellites, both those in geostationary orbit and in polar orbit, provide a wealth of information that meteorologists use routinely to forecast the weather. However, the monitoring of the Arctic remains insufficient, as geostationary satellites have no visibility of this northerly region.The Arctic Weather Satellite is actually the forerunner of a potential constellation of satellites, called EPS-Sterna, that ESA would build for Eumetsat if the first prototype Arctic Weather Satellite works well. Inspecting the Arctic Weather Satellite The EPS-Sterna mission is envisaged as a constellation of six microsatellites in three orbital planes to supply an almost constant stream of temperature and humidity data from every location on Earth.This would, for the first time, allow for very short-range weather forecasting, or ‘nowcasting’, in the Arctic. The set of six microsatellites would be replenished three times.While the Arctic is the focus, meteorologists will also use the constellation to improve weather forecasts globally.Before this, however, the Arctic Weather Satellite prototype has to prove that it works.Hence, embracing the New Space approach by proving new concepts in a cost-effective and timely manner, this new satellite has been developed and built on a very tight schedule.It has taken just 36 months from ESA awarding the industrial prime contract to OHB in Sweden and the satellite being completed.ESA’s Arctic Weather Satellite Project Manager, Ville Kangas, said, “We are right on schedule. The instrument, a microwave radiometer, was delivered by Omnisys the prime contractor for the instrument to OHB in October and integrated on the satellite platform.“And now, thanks to the dedication of the companies involved, we have a complete satellite.”The satellite is now equipped with a 19-channel cross-track scanning microwave radiometer, which benefits from the heritage of the Microwave Sounder developed for the MetOp Second Generation satellites. Arctic Weather Satellite to improve short-term forecasts The instrument will provide high-resolution humidity and temperature soundings of the atmosphere in all weather conditions.Ville continued, “Passing another milestone this month, we also tested the links between the satellite and the mission control centre in KSAT, Tromsø in Norway, which all went according to plan.“With these critical phases done, the satellite has been shipped to IABG in Germany for its environmental test campaign, which will last until February 2024.”These tests will include exposing the satellite to vibrations and noise during liftoff and the temperature differences in vacuum it will have to endure as it orbits Earth.Once these tests have been completed, the satellite will be shipped back to OHB Sweden some final checks before it is shipped to SpaceX’s launch site in Vandenberg, California in April. Liftoff is slated for 1 June 2024 on a Falcon 9 rocket. Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Structural models resisted launch-like noise and vibrations while an electrical model proved its ability to send Galileo signals - a major milestone in the development of Galileo’s Second Generation. G2 satellite model arrives at ESTEC Europe’s Galileo is the world’s most precise satellite navigation system, providing metre-level accuracy to more than four billion users worldwide. It currently comprises 28 satellites in orbit and 10 more are due to be launched, after which a new generation of satellites, the Galileo Second Generation or G2, will revolutionise the fleet with enhanced capabilities.“G2 satellites will be much larger than those of the First Generation, use electric propulsion, host a more powerful navigation antenna, carry more and even better atomic clocks on board and have fully digital payloads,” explains ESA''s Galileo Second Generation Project Manager Miguel Manteiga Bautista. “The modular architecture will offer a high degree of flexibility to accommodate more equipment and inter-satellite links will be enabled,” he adds.ESA, as Galileo’s design authority and system development prime and on behalf of the European Commission, awarded in 2021 the first satellite-building contracts to Thales Alenia Space (IT) and Airbus Defence and Space (DE) to create two independent families of six satellites each.Galileo Second Generation has now reached a significant milestone. Between July and September, two structural models of the Thales Alenia Space satellite and an electrical model of its navigation payload underwent mechanical and signal performance assessment at ESA’s ESTEC Test Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. “The models successfully passed the stringent mechanical, acoustic and radiofrequency tests required by the Galileo Programme,” confirmed Tiziano Sassorossi, Director of G2SB1 Project at Thales Alenia Space Domain Observation and Navigation Programs Italy. Dual launch structure approved Dual launch configuration A structural model is a mechanical representative of a satellite that has dummy masses instead of equipment, tank, propellant and appendages. Thales Alenia Space sent two structural models from Turin, Italy, to ESTEC, where they were exposed to the harsh environmental conditions present during a rocket launch.First, the enormous sound horns at ESA’s Large European Acoustic Facility (LEAF) blasted the models with noise equivalent to multiple jet aircraft lifting off simultaneously. Then, they had to withstand earthquake-like vibrations at the Hydraulic Multi-axis Shaker (Hydra). Finally, they endured a mechanical shock alike to what a satellite experiences during its separation from a rocket.“The satellites will be launched in pairs, one on top of each other and connected to the launcher until separation, so we had to test them in this configuration. Each satellite is over 2000 kg and when stacked, they reach a towering height of seven meters. Seeing the models undergo testing in this configuration was both impressive and nerve-wracking, and we are thrilled that this new design concept for Galileo has received mechanical qualification” said Alberto Bramante, ESA’s Head of Management Office for Thales Alenia Space G2 Satellite. Antenna under scrutiny Team in the Hertz chamber The G2 satellites will carry an innovative navigation payload that is fully digital and reconfigurable in orbit to actively respond to evolving user needs. An electrical model of the Thales Alenia Space payload, an aluminium box with flight-like equipment and antenna, was tested to assess its signal performance.At ESTEC’s Hertz facility, an anechoic chamber isolated from the outside world with radio- and sound-absorbing internal walls, the model radiated transmission in different modes and demonstrated compatibility with Galileo First Generation signals. Full steam ahead for G2 The Galileo Second Generation is in full development phase after the main procurement batch was completed this summer. The European industry is now building the satellites and ultra-precise atomic clocks, and developing the system testbeds, ground mission and ground control segments.In parallel to Thales Alenia Space, Airbus Defence and Space is developing the other half of the constellation, which will be tested for mechanical and signal performance at the company’s facilities in Germany. Vibration test After all testing on the models is complete and the final design details confirmed, the first flight models of both families will be assembled and integrated before undergoing functional and environmental verification, including for some satellites a radiated test campaign in the new test chamber for space antennas being built at ESTEC, Hertz 2.0.This new generation of satellites will start joining the existing constellation in the upcoming years. "G2 is designed to stay in orbit for at least 15 years. We are working hard to make sure the new satellites enable our high-performing navigation system Galileo to go forward into the future with novel capabilities and additional robustness," declares ESA’s Head of Galileo Space Segment Management Office, Andrea Cotellessa.ESA''s Director of Navigation Javier Benedicto confirms: “This first milestone is a powerful testament to the capabilities and unwavering dedication of the European industry and reaffirms ESA’s commitment to redefine the boundaries of satellite navigation. I cannot wait to see the many parts come together to bring to life an even better performing Galileo system, so this EU programme can continue serving European and world citizens.” About Galileo Galileo is currently the world’s most precise satellite navigation system, serving close to four billion users around the globe since entering Open Service in 2017. All smartphones sold in the European Single Market are now guaranteed Galileo-enabled. In addition, Galileo is making a difference across the fields of rail, maritime, agriculture, financial timing services and rescue operations.Galileo is a flagship programme of the European Union, managed and funded by the European Commission. Since its inception, ESA leads the design, development and qualification of the space and ground systems, as well as procuring launches.

With the first Meteosat Third Generation Imager satellite safely in geostationary orbit since December 2022, it’s also time to focus on its polar-orbiting cousin, the MetOp Second Generation mission. And now, for the first time, two MetOp Second Generation satellites have been brought together to stand side-by-side for testing. As its name suggests, the MetOp Second Generation mission, or MetOp-SG for short, will follow-on from the first series of MetOp satellites, which currently provide meteorological observations from polar orbit, and which have had the biggest impact on the accuracy of numerical weather prediction.The Meteosat satellites, which hover 36 000 km above the equator in geostationary orbit, can monitor rapidly evolving events for now-casting and short-term weather prediction. However, being fixed above the equator means and that some parts of Earth are never viewed.The MetOp satellites, on the other hand, orbit Earth from pole to pole and much lower down at an altitude of 832 km, allowing them to achieve global coverage every few days and make more detailed observations.The complementarity of having satellites in both geostationary and polar orbits is key to accurate weather forecasting. MetOp Second Generation Comprising six satellites in total, the new MetOp-SG mission is based on a pair of satellites, type-A and type-B, that carry different instruments. The series is set to deliver a wealth of meteorological information for over 20 years.The main reason why MetOp Second Generation has been designed to work as a pair is because the instruments needed are so large that it takes two satellites to accommodate them.Each pair of satellites carries a total of ten instruments. The instruments are either significantly improved versions of those on the first generation or completely new, to provide measurements of unprecedented accuracy – not only for numerical weather prediction, but also for nowcasting at high latitudes, climate monitoring, atmospheric chemistry, oceanology, hydrology, and land applications.The first MetOp-SG-A satellite has been at Airbus’ facilities in Toulouse, France, for about a year now, but it was recently joined by the first MetOp-SG-B satellite for a series of tests.ESA’s MetOp-SG Project Manager, Marc Loiselet, said, “Having the first MetOp-SG-A and MetOp-SG-B in the same cleanroom is a unique opportunity to admire both satellites and their range of instruments, all of which have been developed and manufactured in Europe.” First MetOp-SG-A and MetOp-SG-B show off “The A-type satellite carries instruments that image in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths, and atmospheric sounders that work in the infrared and microwave frequencies.”The METimage instrument, provided by the DLR German Aerospace Center, will provide very accurate 2D images of clouds sensed in infrared and visible bands.IASI-NG, provided by the CNES French Space Agency, is an infrared sounder to provide 3D maps of atmospheric temperature and humidity as well as a spectrum of many different chemicals.In addition, the Microwave Sounder will provide 3D maps of atmospheric temperature and humidity by taking observations in the microwave frequency range.The 3MI instrument will be used to assess the impact of the aerosols on meteorology.An instrument called Radio Occultation, which by tracking satellite navigation systems including Galileo, will provide very accurate vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. This instrument is accommodated on both A-type and B-type satellites.The A-type satellite also carries the Copernicus Sentinel-5 mission to monitor air pollution and atmospheric ozone.“The B-type satellites will provide images in the microwave and makes observations of ocean-surface winds and soil moisture,” added Marc Loiselet. MetOp-SG-B ready for testing The Microwave Imager will provide images of precipitation and clouds as well as profiles of water vapour. The Ice Cloud Imager will, for the first time, provide images of ice clouds, which impact Earth’s radiation budget and so far not yet accounted for.The scatterometer will provide ocean surface wind vectors and soil moisture. The final payload is the ARGOS-4 data collection system to collect data from various transmitters on Earth’s surface, in the sea and in the air.The MetOp-SG mission is a cooperation between Eumetsat and ESA. ESA is responsible the development of the first two satellites and, on behalf of Eumetsat for the procurement of the four recurrent satellites. Eumetsat defines the overall system and user requirements, develops the ground systems, procures the launch services, operates the satellites, and makes the data available to users.The mission is also the European component of the Joint Polar System – a collaboration between Eumetsat and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Both organisations’ polar-orbiting satellites bring benefits to weather forecasting and climate monitoring all over the world.With Airbus as prime contractor, more than 110 companies in 17 countries are involved in building the MetOp-SG satellites. The first satellite-A and satellite-B will both be ready for launch in 2025, although the actual dates for liftoff are yet to be confirmed.The MetOp-SG satellites are also the first European satellites designed for a controlled reentry at the end of their life in orbit.

MANTIS carries a high-resolution multispectral camera coupled with a powerful AI processing unit.Intuition-1 was also launched on the same rocket and will similarly demonstrate the advantages of onboard AI capabilities, in this case in tandem with a hyperspectral imager. The satellite’s machine learning algorithms were developed under the ESA-funded Genesis project The two satellites lifted off from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, US, at 18:49 GMT (19:49 CET, 10:49 PST) on 11 November.MANTIS and Intuition-1 were delivered into orbit about one hour after liftoff. Customer-focused intelligence from space MANTIS mission patch The MANTIS mission is the brainchild of UK-based company Open Cosmos. Founded in 2015, the company focuses on the design, manufacture and operation of small Earth observation satellites, along with providing remote-sensing data services.MANTIS, which is short for Mission Agile Nanosatellite for Terrestrial Imagery Services, is primarily aimed at the energy and mining sector and was conceived as a means to alleviate the need for ground-based monitoring of sites in inaccessible regions.Based on a 12U CubeSat platform, the satellite has at its heart a compact binocular telescope from the Spanish company Satlantis. The instrument operates in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range and boasts a resolution of just 2.5 m.The onboard computational unit processes the imagery using AI algorithms created by IngeniArs in Italy, meaning that the data downlinked to the ground have already had unwanted features like clouds removed. Further processing is completed by British company Terrabotics’ analytics, delivering actionable insight to the customer on their chosen locations.As ESA’s Earth Observation commercialisation programme, InCubed supports many upstream activities involving the launch of satellites by European private operators, including Ororatech, constellr and Kuva Space. MANTIS is the first InCubed-supported satellite to lift off from the launch pad and so represents a significant landmark for the programme.InCubed contributed to the development of MANTIS with financial support together with technical and business mentoring, working closely with the Open Cosmos project team to review progress at key milestones. Funding was made available thanks to the UK Space Agency’s contribution to ESA. MANTIS key facts “We’re enormously proud of our achievement in making MANTIS a reality, a venture made possible through extensive collaboration with our partners and the unyielding support of ESA,” said Open Cosmos Chief Operations Officer Aleix Megias.“MANTIS will empower organisations and enterprises to manage natural resources more sustainably, and we also envisage a host of further applications for its datasets, such as climate emergency monitoring, water management and biodiversity conservation.” An eye on soil health Intuition-1, built by Poland’s KP Labs, is a 6U CubeSat technology demonstrator that will show how AI can deliver in-orbit processing of hyperspectral data for soil analysis.Intuition-1’s hyperspectral camera captures and segments light across a broad spectrum, enabling the identification of a number of soil health indicators such as potassium oxide, phosphorus pentoxide, magnesium and pH level.Computational muscle is provided by an orbit-resilient data processing unit which, by pre-processing and filtering the images, is expected to reduce the volume of data transferred daily to ground from around 100 GB to just 300 MB. Intuition-1 mission patch The majority of the AI models for Intuition-1 were developed within the ESA FutureEO-funded Genesis activity.Working with ESA’s data science experts, KP Labs created a machine learning ‘pipeline’ that will process raw data on the satellite while continuing to improve its performance through a continual learning process and a seamless interaction between the satellite and the ground.In-flight validation of Intuition-1’s payload and AI algorithms will commence in the Spring of 2024.“This is a fantastic moment for us, with not one but two commercially oriented satellites launched on the same flight with ESA Φ-lab support,” said Head of ESA Φ-lab Giuseppe Borghi.“Both of these Earth observation missions will demonstrate how the power of AI in space can create value for the benefit of industry and society as a whole.”ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programmes, Simonetta Cheli, added, “We warmly congratulate Open Cosmos and KP Labs on the launch of their satellites.“Through commercial initiatives and targeted disruptive innovation funding, ESA Φ-lab is able to provide a catalyst for European Earth observation businesses, and it’s particularly pleasing to see InCubed achieve the major milestone of its first supported satellite reaching orbit.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

With funding programmes, business guidance for companies, and multiyear contracts, ESA provides a vital springboard for continued growth in commercial Earth observation. The global Earth observation data and service market is estimated to be worth around €2 billion every year and predicted to increase to €7–9 billion by 2032. But despite this wealth of opportunity at a global level, companies in the commercial Earth observation sector in Europe may find getting off the ground difficult owing to the complexity of navigating the investment landscape.As a major partner for space suppliers, ESA has a crucial role to play in stimulating European industry and has enshrined commercialisation in its Agenda 2025. The Agency can help ensure pathways to expansion for commercialisation activities for start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises, and large companies in a number of ways. This includes organising commercial industry events, providing funding support and by becoming an anchor customer. The Earth observation angle In Earth observation, ESA is nurturing commercialisation in all three of these strands. The recent Earth Observation Commercialisation Forum brought entrepreneurs and start-ups together with capital providers, giving an ideal matchmaking platform for discussions on investment and partnerships.ESA makes direct funding available to the European Earth observation sector via the InCubed programme, a vehicle for the development of innovative, commercially successful products and services. Launched in 2018, InCubed supports companies with co-funding, along with technical, industrial and business development mentoring, in order to develop their ideas up to market launch.To date, InCubed has co-financed over 70 activities for a total project cost of more than €124 million, of which around 63% on average is funded by the programme. Subscription to InCubed by ESA Member States is voluntary and now includes 21 countries, with a total subscription value of around €200 million.All parts of the Earth observation value chain fall within the remit of InCubed, from satellites, sensors and data transmission through to the ground segment, customer applications and even innovative business models. European emerging Copernicus Contributing Missions Homing in on satellites, a substantial stimulus to the European market stems from the Copernicus Contributing Missions (CCMs). ESA develops, builds and in many cases operates the Sentinel satellite missions for Copernicus, but also coordinates the contributing missions on behalf of the European Commission.These currently consist of around 20 operational satellites from private companies that supply complementary commercial very-high-resolution data, and nine further European emerging enterprises have recently been added to the roster.One of the objectives of the CCM strategy, derived with the European Commission, is to build momentum in European Earth observation New Space, and a fundamental element of that strategy is the concept of the anchor customer. By awarding CCM contracts of up to five years to European emerging data providers, ESA acts as an ‘anchor’ or enabler for growth in the European market.Anchor contracts give the industry a longer-term perspective of data sales for European public needs, meaning that companies can better plan their activities and, significantly, attract investment from private investors. Start-up stories Several of the latest InCubed and CCM emerging companies illustrate how ESA’s multifaceted support generates considerable traction in Earth observation New Space and encourages private investment.OroraTech was originally given a helping hand by the incubation programmes ESA BIC Bavaria and ESA Kick-Start, before being awarded funding from InCubed for the development of its wildfire detection CubeSat. The German start-up was then able to raise further capital from public and private investors, giving a grand total of €15 million to bring its products to market.OroraTech’s deep involvement with ESA, along with its successful launch of two missions, paved the way for its CCM contract. OroraTech wildfire detection in British Columbia Like OroraTech, fellow German company constellr will supply thermal infrared data to Copernicus. Its HiVE mission was originally funded by a mix of InCubed and venture capital, and shortly after the awarding of the CCM contract, constellr announced that it was to receive a further €17 million in seed funding from a number of investors.Finnish start-up Kuva Space and Belgium’s Aerospacelab have both enjoyed a similar journey of InCubed funding, private investment and joining the CCMs. Aerospacelab’s rapid evolution since its inception in 2018 has led to it garnering a sizeable €40 million in investor funding last year.AIRMO is another example of a start-up receiving a significant investor capital injection in conjunction with its InCubed support, and other CCM data providers are in the process of obtaining additional funding.Commenting on the wider significance of these success stories, ESA’s Michele Castorina said, “Because of InCubed’s comprehensive evaluation process and continued guidance and monitoring, attaining co-funding from the programme is a cast-iron endorsement of the market viability of start-ups’ products and services.“As we’ve seen many times, the award of ESA funding or supply contracts to a business helps to give confidence to other investors and customers, thereby unlocking further capital and growth.”“The CCMs are a win-win for European Earth observation,” added ESA’s Peggy Fischer. “Not only do these commercial missions greatly enhance the datasets available to Copernicus services, but the intrinsic assurance of business continuity in the anchor contracts clearly creates a multiplier effect in the European New Space sector.“It’s also encouraging to see InCubed alumni companies joining the CCMs, a perfect demonstration of ESA’s nurturing of Earth observation New Space ventures from development to market release and beyond.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

This novel approach is in stark contrast to the laborious and time-consuming manual efforts needed previously. Anne Braakmann-Folgmann, lead author of the findings published today in The Cryosphere, conducted her research during her tenure as a PhD student at the University of Leeds in the UK. Now working at the Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø, she emphasised the significance of large icebergs in the Antarctic environment.“Giant icebergs are important components of the Antarctic environment. They impact ocean physics, chemistry, biology and, of course, maritime operations. Therefore, it is crucial to locate icebergs and monitor their extent, to quantify how much meltwater they release into the ocean.”Providing images of icebergs regardless of cloud cover and lack of daylight, the Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar mission plays a pivotal role in the innovative approach of using Artificial Intelligence to map bergs.In images from satellites carrying camera-like instruments, icebergs, sea ice and clouds all appear white, making it hard to pick out actual icebergs. Sentinel-1''s radar vision Whereas in most radar images, as returned by Sentinel-1, icebergs appear as bright objects against the darker ocean and sea-ice background.Nevertheless, when the surroundings are complex, it can still sometimes be difficult to differentiate icebergs from sea ice or even the from the coastline.Dr Braakmann-Folgmann, explained, “We have sometimes struggled to separate icebergs from surrounding sea ice that is rougher and older, and therefore looks brighter in the satellite images. The same applies to wind-roughened ocean.“Also, smaller iceberg fragments, which occur frequently near icebergs as they constantly lose bits of ice around their edges, are easily grouped together with the main iceberg by mistake.“In addition, the Antarctic coastline may resemble icebergs in the satellite images, so standard segmentation algorithms often select the coast too instead of just the actual iceberg.”The new neural network approach, however, excels in mapping iceberg extent even in these challenging conditions. Its power lies in the neural networks'' ability to understand intricate non-linear relationships and take the whole image context into account.To effectively track changes in iceberg area and thickness, essential for understanding how icebergs dissolve and release freshwater and nutrients into the ocean, pinpointing a specific giant iceberg for continuous monitoring is crucial. Using AI to measure the size of icebergs The neural network introduced in this study is highly proficient in identifying the largest iceberg in each image, unlike comparative methods, which frequently select slightly smaller icebergs in proximity.The architecture of the neural network is based on the renowned U-net design. It was meticulously trained using Sentinel-1 images exhibiting giant icebergs in various settings, with manually-derived outlines serving as the target.Throughout the training process, the system continually refines its predictions, adjusting its parameters based on the difference between the manually derived outline and the predicted result. Training ceases automatically when the system reaches its optimum performance, ensuring its adaptability and success on new examples.The algorithm has been tested on seven icebergs, ranging in size from 54 sq km to 1052 sq km, roughly equivalent to the areas of the city of Bern in Switzerland and Hong Kong, respectively.A diverse dataset was compiled, incorporating between 15 and 46 images for each iceberg, spanning various seasons and the years 2014 –2020.A single Sentinel-1 image per month per iceberg was used to ensure dataset variety. Presenting an accuracy of 99%, the results have been impressive.Dr Braakmann-Folgmann added, “Being able to map iceberg extent automatically with enhanced speed and accuracy will enable us to observe changes in iceberg area for several giant icebergs more easily and paves the way for an operational application.”ESA’s Mark Drinkwater noted, “Satellites are, of course, essential for monitoring changes and understanding processes occurring far from civilisation. This new neural network automates what would otherwise be a manual and labour-intensive task of locating and reporting iceberg extent.“We congratulate the team on the introduction of this innovative machine learning approach, to achieve a robust and accurate approach to monitoring changes in the vulnerable Antarctic region.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Heatwave across Europe The climate crisis is arguably the greatest global challenge we face today, with far-reaching consequences for our planet''s ecosystems, economies and societies.As world leaders grapple with the urgency of climate action, the role of space-based technology and data has become increasingly critical.Access to actionable information is fundamental to fight climate change, to support knowledge-based policies and initiatives and their implementation, and to ensure that this is balanced with sustainable economic development and societal benefits.ESA and the Commission’s Directorate-General for Climate Action (CLIMA) are, therefore, seizing the opportunity to harness their combined expertise and resources to bring about transformative change, not least in the context of the EU’s Copernicus space programme and ESA’s Space for a Green Future Accelerator. Space for a Green Future Earth-observing satellites and the data they provide already offer the tools and solutions to effectively support, understand, monitor, mitigate and adapt to climate change.Through Europe’s Copernicus programme, satellites deliver systematic data for a multitude of everyday services that benefit society in many ways.Here, services include the Climate Change Service. It supports adaptation and mitigation policies of the European Union by providing consistent and authoritative information about climate change.Its primary objective is to help the European Union achieve its ambitious goal of becoming the world''s first climate-neutral continent by 2050, as laid out in the European Green Deal.Multidecadal satellite datasets compiled through ESA’s Climate Change Initiative underpin Essential Climate Variables to support the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and provide an impartial yardstick to understand climate processes and identify the impacts of change. Key components of the climate system In addition, ESA’s FutureEO programme harnesses novel ideas to develop pioneering satellite missions and concepts, nurturing imaginative new ways of using Earth observation that enables scientific excellence to flourish and address environmental challenges of tomorrow.While both ESA and the European Union are already actively addressing the climate crisis, more can be done, particularly by better exploiting the transition that the space sector is currently experiencing.To this end, ESA and CLIMA are reinforcing their cooperation by working together even more closely and looking into more opportunities to use space-based solutions for climate mitigation and adaptation. This includes, for example, exploring better monitoring, reporting and verification solutions for greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, detecting methane leaks, identifying specific legislation that could benefit from Earth observation data, helping to identify site locations for renewable energy plants.The initiative also supports the development of tailormade tools, such as the Green Transition Information Factory, and furthering the European Union’s Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Regulation. Faenza flood map Furthermore, the initiative will seek to assist industries and public organisations from multiple sectors to assess risks and implement decarbonisation strategies.ESA’s Director General, Josef Aschbacher, said, “The climate crisis is upon us, and we have to act fast and act together for the benefit of Europe and, indeed, the world.“Through this new initiative, together we will develop a structured cooperation that paves the way for information-sharing, mutual consultations and joint plans.“Exploiting the complementarity between our respective programmes, together we will advance climate science, support policy implementation and boost green innovation on the road to the European Green Deal and a carbon-neutral future.” Uniting on climate action from space The European Commission’s Director General for Climate Action, Kurt Vandenberghe, added, “Space, and in particular Earth observation, offers a unique perspective on how to tackle climate challenges faced by humanity.“Space technologies are crucial for reaching climate neutrality and climate resilience by 2050. Through our joint initiative, we are committed to exploring and enhancing opportunities for the development and broader implementation of space-based solutions dedicated to climate action.” The power of Earth observation Access the video Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

With global climate change increasingly affecting our planet, EarthCARE''s advanced instruments and technology are poised to provide invaluable data for climate research, improve the accuracy of climate models and support numerical weather prediction.Specifically, EarthCARE, which is short for the Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer, will answer some critical scientific questions related to the role that clouds and aerosols play in both reflecting incident solar radiation back out to space and trapping infrared radiation emitted from Earth’s surface. This delicate balance is an important factor in regulating Earth’s climate.Although it is known that clouds play an extremely important role in atmospheric heating and cooling, they remain one of the biggest uncertainties in our understanding of how the atmosphere drives the climate system. EarthCARE measuring clouds and aerosols Access the video EarthCARE''s unique set of four instruments will provide a holistic view of the interplay between clouds, aerosols and radiation.Its cloud profiling radar will provide information on the vertical structure and internal dynamics of clouds, its atmospheric lidar will provide cloud-top information and profiles of thin clouds and aerosols, its multispectral imager will provide a wide-scene overview in multiple wavelengths, and its broad-band radiometer will measure reflected solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation.The fact that these different measurements are all taken at the same time allows scientists to better understand Earth’s radiation balance. EarthCARE standing proud in the anechoic chamber EarthCARE is the largest of ESA’s Earth Explorer satellites to date and, carrying such a comprehensive instrument package, development and testing has, unsurprisingly, been complex over the years.More recently the satellite spent around 12 months at ESA’s ESTEC Test Centre in the Netherlands – the largest satellite test facility in Europe.This 3000 sq m, environmentally-controlled facility hosts test equipment to simulate every aspect of the space environment, from the vacuum and temperature extremes of Earth orbit to the violent noise and vibration of a rocket launch.With these tests completed in the Netherlands, the satellite has now been shipped to Airbus in Germany for the last round of checks, which included testing for the transmitted shock when separating from the rocket’s adapter ring.ESA’s EarthCARE Project Manager, Dirk Bernaerts, said, “We are extremely happy to see EarthCARE in great shape, with the tests demonstrating that the satellite will withstand the rigours of liftoff and the harsh environment of space. EarthCARE being lowered in the Large Space Simulator “We will soon be gearing up for the launch and then very much look forward to seeing our satellite deliver the data that is so needed by the scientific community.“In fact, next month we are holding a science and validation workshop to help familiarise the science community with EarthCARE products, tools and databases, and more.”The satellite is scheduled to be packed up and shipped to the Vandenberg launch site in California in early March, where it will be prepared for liftoff on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in May.EarthCARE is a joint venture between ESA and JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.

ESA is a key driving force for the development of European Earth observation and provides impetus through its many programmes and initiatives.To set the scene ahead of ESA’s Earth Observation Commercialisation Forum next week, here is some need-to-know background information on the evolution and state of play of the Earth observation industry. 1) Relatively small but ramping upAccording to Euroconsult, the entire global space economy was worth a remarkable US$464 billion in 2022, and while the Earth observation portion is only around 4% of that figure, the sector is undergoing significant growth.Looking at the trend over time, the space economy as a whole has seen annual growth of 7% since 2017, and this is broadly expected to continue up to 2031. A presentation at the Summit on Earth Observation Business (SEOB) in September predicted a similar trajectory for the Earth observation data and service market, increasing from US$4.6 billion last year to US$8 billion by 2032.2) The innovation and adoption horizonTerrawatchSpace has carried out a Gartner Hype Cycle analysis on the commercial Earth observation sector, with a look at both the technological and application perspectives. Technologies such as SAR, Hyperspectral, Edge Computing in Space and Thermal Infrared have created significant buzz in recent years, but remain in the early phases of development.In terms of application sectors, some of the significant areas on the rise are thought to be carbon monitoring, parametric insurance, climate risk reporting and pipeline monitoring, although adoption remains at an initial stage.3) Going backwards to move forwardEarth observation is increasingly being seen as a strategic asset for organisations, giving rise to a process of backward vertical integration – going a step back in the value chain to acquire or partner with a satellite provider.Energy companies Williams and ONEOK, several Indian banks and consultancy Accenture have all invested in satellite operators, while insurance giants Aon and agriculture market leader Bayer have established partnerships with ICEYE and Planet respectively.4) The European Earth observation canvasThe European Earth observation industry is dominated by SMEs (Small and Medium-sized Enterprises) which are mainly active in solely downstream activities.The rest of the world has a larger proportion of capital-intensive businesses, showing a more favourable mix of industrial maturity, together with a higher concentration of start-ups and LSIs (Large System Integrators) and larger average company sizes. This may be related to higher and more stable domestic demand and easier access to private investments.A number of strategic directions may be taken to give better support to European commercial Earth observation. The creation and nurturing of start-ups could be increased, including mechanisms for both start-ups and SMEs to scale up. Businesses should draw on the unique technical excellence across the continent to offer more diverse end-to-end products and services.Thirdly, access to funding from both public institutions and private investors could be made easier, with support tailored to the needs of not only start-ups but also more mature companies.5) The cash injection inflectionAs reported by Euroconsult at SEOB, private investment in commercial space grew from US$1.4 billion worldwide in 2017 to a peak of US$14.9 billion in 2021, only to fall back to US$6.3 billion last year.In Earth observation, Terrawatch Space recorded a 37% share in Europe of the global total from private investors in 2022, with over 25 funding rounds taking place. However, last year was exceptional, as the European share of capital injection in Earth observation commerce was around 20% on average in the 2017 to 2021 period.6) Breaking down barriersExperts envisage several hurdles that need to be overcome for the European Earth observation market to continue to flourish. There is still demand which is not being met by current suppliers, and this is coupled with a need for market creation to take advantage of opportunities for diversified data and innovative services.The lack of awareness of the value of Earth observation among many non-space companies is limiting its adoption, and where there is awareness, price is perceived as a barrier for some business cases.The quality, availability and reliability of Earth observation products need to improve in order to increase customer take-up and retention, and finally there is still significant market uncertainty due to a lack of characterisation of business cases. ESA Earth Observation Commercialisation ForumThe first-ever ESA Earth Observation Commercialisation Forum will provide a treasure chest of information and discussions on all these topics and many more. With keynote addresses and deep analysis from institutions, industry experts and investors, the two-day gathering commences on 30 October and is the must-see event for all aspects of Earth observation New Space.See the dedicated website for more details and follow the proceedings live on ESA WebTV Two.

Satellite navigation has become indispensable in our daily lives and is used in a myriad of applications, from guiding aircraft and driverless cars to monitoring water supplies and responding to emergencies. But satnav systems are potentially vulnerable to jamming and spoofing as their signal power on the ground is weak and most of their specifications are publicly available. From 18 to 22 September, a team from ESA joined one of the world’s largest jamming testing campaigns, Norway’s Jammertest, together with dozens of participants from governmental agencies, industry and academia. An ESA telecommunications and navigation testbed vehicle usually based at ESTEC, in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, was driven to Norway for its first mission beyond Dutch borders.The jamming testing campaign was organised by the Norwegian Communications Authority, the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and Norwegian Metrology Service and backed by the Norwegian Space Agency. The island of Andøya, a remote area in the north of Norway, was turned into a temporary outdoor laboratory where the organisers interfered with the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal in a controlled environment. ESA''s navigation testbed vehicle ESA’s testbed vehicle had been upgraded for this adventure: it was equipped with a variety of satnav receivers, antennas that ranged from the most sophisticated to mass market grade, interference monitoring equipment, antijamming antennas and other interference mitigation systems, and an inertial navigation system that served as the ‘source of truth’, an independent relative positioning reference to compare readings from the receivers to the actual position of the vehicle. In addition to this, the van also carried an electronic support system and special batteries to power its instruments, as well as plenty of radiofrequency equipment and battery back-ups.The equipment allowed ESTEC navigation engineers to test the performance of satnav systems and their resilience against jamming, but also spoofing – the sending of fake signals to mislead users about their location – as well as ‘meaconing’, where signals are intercepted and rebroadcast in a misleading way. The team evaluated the capabilities of monitoring and mitigation systems too. Town of Bleik, Andøya The testing site was already a challenging location for satnav systems: the high latitude means that fewer satellites are visible in the local sky compared to further south, and potential ionospheric activity linked to the northern latitudes can also interfere with signals. Experimenting with European innovation Pedestrian satnav testing equipment Among the equipment that was tested were devices developed in the framework of ESA’s Navigation Innovation and Support Programme (NAVISP), that focuses on devising novel positioning, navigation and timing technologies and services to boost Member State industrial competitiveness and innovation.The team deployed a portable compact Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection system developed by SINTEF as part of the project ARFIDAAS: Advanced RFI Detection, Alerting and Analysis System. This device can record, analyse and classify interfering signals as soon as they are detected. ARFIDAAS was used to scan the electromagnetic environment before the start of each testing session to detect signal interferences unrelated to the campaign and derive an interference-free baseline. The ESA team also tested a NAVISP-funded demonstrator receiver developed by FocalPoint. This device uses their patented technology Supercorrelation, which improves GNSS accuracy, sensitivity and integrity, increasing resilience to jamming attacks as well as allowing sky scanning and detecting spoofed signals.NAVISP Industry Days, taking place on 7 and 8 November at ESTEC, will feature two presentations about Jammertest where participants will be able to learn more about the event and the team’s experience in Andøya, including how they overcame challenges such as winds of up to 100 km/h and a flock of wild sheep interrupting a convoy mid-test. Galileo holds strong ESA team at Jammertest 2023 The Galileo system undergoes extensive testing in controlled indoor laboratory environments with the use of simulation equipment. Outdoor testing campaigns like Jammertest provide a unique opportunity for ESA, as the Galileo System Design Authority, to complement lab tests in real outdoor environments and feed the continuous improvement cycle that keeps the system protected against vulnerabilities.“With this test we are closing the loop: we have been able to test the performance of different GNSS receivers and we can now provide feedback to ESA’s Galileo system design team” says Radio Navigation Engineer Xurxo Otero Villamide.Five days of testing produced terabytes of data that were recorded and stored. Engineers will now be able to replay the results and study them at ESTEC. Ground and User Segment Engineer Luciano Musumeci adds: “The primary campaign objective was to collect an extensive database for future exploitation, to support internal R&D activities for example. This has been successfully accomplished: we can use these data for years to come.” Jammertest 2023 participants Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

While this underscores the accelerating impacts of climate change on the world''s southernmost continent, the picture of ice deterioration is mixed. The study, funded by ESA’s Earth Observation Science for Society programme and now published in the journal Science Advances, is based on 100,000 satellite radar images to produce a major assessment of the ‘state of the health’ of Antarctica’s ice shelves. These massive floating extensions of the continent''s ice sheet play a crucial role in stabilising the region''s glaciers by acting as buttresses, slowing the flow of ice into the ocean.The Antarctic, therefore, faces a double whammy – as the ice shelves get smaller, the rate of ice lost from the ice sheet increases.The research team, led by scientists from the University of Leeds, found that 71 of the 162 ice shelves around Antarctica have reduced in volume, releasing almost 67 trillion tonnes of meltwater into the ocean. Apart from the issue of the ice shelves losing mass, this addition of freshwater into the ocean could have implications for ocean circulation patterns.Moreover, the research team found that almost all the ice shelves on the western side of Antarctica experienced ice loss. In contrast, most of the ice shelves on the eastern side remained intact or increased in mass. Antarctic ice shelf demise Access the video Benjamin Davison, a research fellow at the University of Leeds, said, “There is a mixed picture of ice-shelf deterioration, and this is to do with the ocean temperature and ocean currents around Antarctica.“The western half is exposed to warm water, which can rapidly erode the ice shelves from below, whereas much of East Antarctica is currently protected by a band of cold water at the coast.”Antarctica is a vast continent, and the seas on the western side experience different currents and winds compared to the east, and this drives warmer water underneath the ice shelves on the western flank.As a result, the Getz Ice Shelf experienced some of the biggest ice losses, where 1.9 trillion tonnes of ice were lost over the 25-year study period. Just 5% of this was caused by calving, where large chunks of ice breakaway from the shelf and fall into the ocean. The rest was due to melting at the base of the ice shelf.Similarly, the Pine Island Ice Shelf lost 1.3 trillion tonnes of ice. Around a third of this loss – 450 billion tonnes – was due to calving. The rest was because of melting from the underside of the ice shelf.In contrast, the Amery Ice Shelf – on the other side of Antarctica and surrounded by much colder waters – gained 1.2 trillion tonnes of ice. Getz Ice Shelf from Sentinel-1 Dr Davison added, “We expected most ice shelves to go through cycles of rapid, but short-lived shrinking, then to regrow slowly. Instead, we see that almost half of them are shrinking with no sign of recovery.”Anna Hogg, also from the University of Leeds, said, “The study has generated important findings. We tend to think of ice shelves as going through cyclical advances and retreats. Instead, we are seeing a steady attrition owing to melting and calving.“Many of the ice shelves have deteriorated a lot: 48 lost more than 30% of their initial mass over just 25 years. This is further evidence that Antarctica is changing because the climate is warming.”Satellites are key to monitoring the remote polar region. Apart from being remote, they are shrouded in darkness during their polar winters. Radar vision Here, satellites carrying radar instruments, which can ‘see’ through the dark and provide images and measurements year-round are particularly relevant.The Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission is Europe’s prime radar mission, providing images no matter whether it is day or night and whatever the weather. ESA’s CryoSat carries a radar altimeter to measure changes in the height of the ice, which are needed to calculate changes in actual ice volume.Noel Gourmelen, from the University of Edinburgh and Earthwave, noted, “ESA’s CryoSat has also been an incredible tool for monitoring the polar environment.“Its ability to precisely map the erosion of ice shelves by the ocean below enabled this accurate quantification and partitioning of ice shelf loss, but also revealed fascinating details on how this erosion takes place.” ESA''s ice mission ESA’s Mark Drinkwater said, “Monitoring and tracking climate change across the vast Antarctic continent requires a satellite system that captures data routinely throughout the year.“The European Copernicus programme’s Sentinel-1 satellite mission has fulfilled this need. Together with the historical data acquired by its ESA predecessors ERS-1, ERS -2 and Envisat, the Sentinel-1 mission has revolutionised our ability to take stock of floating ice shelves, as a bellwether for mass balance and the health of the Antarctic ice sheet. “In the near future, we will further augment Antarctic monitoring with three new polar-focused missions CRISTAL, CIMR and ROSE-L.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Now ESA has partnered with ICEYE, a Finnish microsatellite manufacturer, to improve early warning systems for floods and wildfires and extend their geographical coverage globally. Using synthetic aperture radar technology enables ICEYE’s satellites to see through the smoke while the fires are still burning, so emergency teams can pinpoint individual homes and people at risk – as well as precious natural habitats. First responders can use the information to follow the unfolding dangers and assess the impact.The same technology also enables emergency teams to see through storm clouds to assess the extent of flooding, its depth and probable duration, creating actionable intelligence on natural disasters by providing data in near-real time. Space data can also help to predict floods, avert disasters and speed recovery.The three-year project, called “Crisis observations and management from space”, is an ESA Partnership Project with ICEYE under the agency’s Civil Security from Space programme. It is being led from ICEYE’s headquarters in Finland with contributions from the company’s offices in Spain and Poland.The work will inform efforts to accelerate the use of space to provide a rapid and resilient response to crises on Earth. ESA is working with organisations across Europe to deliver such a system to safeguard people when terrestrial systems are damaged by natural hazards, accidents or malicious actions. Rafal Modrzewski of Finnish microsatellite manufacturer ICEYE and Josef Aschbacher of ESA Rafal Modrzewski, CEO and Co-Founder at ICEYE, said: “This partnership is an opportunity to test the boundaries of natural catastrophe monitoring solutions, alongside ESA. The civil security from space programme demonstrates the commitment of ESA and the European space community to use space technology to build community resilience. We are honoured to have been selected to participate in this programme, and to be at the forefront of the new space-based crisis observation and management era.”Josef Aschbacher, Director General of ESA, said: “I am delighted to sign the first ESA Partnership Project with ICEYE under the civil security from space programme, supporting European efforts to use space to monitor, mitigate and resolve civil security and crisis events to keep people, infrastructures and resources safe on Earth.

ESA-funded research shows that the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission and the Italian Prisma mission could be used to monitor the nutritional content of staple crops. This could, for example, help farmers take appropriate steps to boost the quality of their crops as they grow. Malnutrition from a lack of micronutrients such as calcium and potassium affects more than two billion people – that’s over 25% of the global population.This type of malnutrition is a particular problem for those relying on crop-based diets and limited access to nutrient-rich food.It is sometimes referred to as a ‘hidden hunger’ because, in some cases, people may be consuming enough calories, but not actually getting enough essential nutrients and vitamins.This can lead to serious health problems, including impaired physical and mental development, increased susceptibility to various diseases and even premature death.The rising global population and the climate crisis are already adding to the issue of food security, so ensuring basic crops are as nutritious as possible is becoming increasingly relevant. HyNutri study site in Italy Conventional methods for measuring nutrient concentration typically involve collecting grain during the harvesting period and analysing the samples in a laboratory. These methods are clearly too costly and time-consuming to be applied on a large scale.In addition, as the nutrients are only measured after harvest, these methods preclude effective intervention with fertilisers while the crop is still growing.To overcome these limitations, scientists from the University of Twente in the Netherlands and the National Research Council of Italy led research into the potential of using satellites to monitor crop nutrients over large areas and that would give sufficient time for farmers to intervene with fertilisers or other agricultural practices before they actually harvest.Most satellite optical sensors use a few broad spectral bands that are not sensitive to crop nutritional content.However, the hyperspectral instrument carried on the Italian Space Agency’s Prisma mission and the multispectral instrument carried on the Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission are sensitive to features related to the nutritional content, with their different spectral bands showing varying levels of sensitivity.The team selected a test site in the Po Valley in Italy and focused on four crops: corn, rice, soybean and wheat. They then compared signals in the satellite data that related to nutrients such as phosphorus, magnesium, zinc and potassium with nutrients measured in the laboratory.Their research was supported by an ESA Earth Observation Science for Society project called ‘HyNutri Sensing Hidden Hunger with Sentinel-2 and Hyperspectral’.The team’s results have been published in the journal Remote Sensing of the Environment. Micronutrient deficiency is prevalent in parts of Africa Mariana Belgiu, from the University of Twente, said, “These first attempts to estimate and predict micro-and macro-nutrient concentration of staple crops from Prisma and Sentinel-2 are indeed encouraging for some nutrients, such as potassium (K), phosphorous (P), magnesium (Mg) and iron.“However, for other nutrients the feasibility remains an open question that needs further investigation. Thanks to ESA’s Science for Society programme, we have launched a follow-on project, EO4Nutri, to take this step.”ESA’s Espen Volden noted, “We hope this research will eventually lead to farmers being able to intervene and boost the nutrient quality of grains early in the growing season, or for governments and food security organisations to plan other activities ensuring sufficient nutrients for vulnerable populations.“This is particularly relevant for countries in Africa, for example, where macro- and micro-nutrient deficiency is more prevalent.“Looking to the future, a new satellite mission called CHIME, which ESA is developing for Europe’s Copernicus programme, will carry a new hyperspectral instrument and will also be suitable for determining crop nutrient content – and hopefully help efforts in alleviating hidden hunger.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Ariane 6 will launch several satellites, deployers and experiments from space agencies, companies, research institutes, universities and young professionals on its first flight. In-depth “Ariane 6 is designed to be versatile, offering space actors bespoke launch options all while keeping costs down,” says Michel Bonnet, head of Ariane 6 missions and system engineering and ESA’s lead for the Ariane 6 inaugural flight. “The varied missions launching on the first flight, from nine countries and dozens of organisations, are a perfect demonstration of the team spirit behind this rocket and the design ethos that underpins it.” Ariane 6 possible missions and configurations From established players like NASA to students designing their first ever satellite, these missions will measure gamma rays, track wildlife, test self-healing solar cells, confirm the theory of black body radiation and more. There''s a smart-farming satellite, a radio beacon demonstrator, experiments that will remain attached to the rocket''s payload ‘adaptor’ and even capsules destined to reenter Earth’s atmosphere to test new materials – Ariane 6’s first flight will be packed with technology as its first payloads are sent on their way into space. This plethora of missions is being supplied by three types of organisations: commercial companies, space agencies and universities. Together they have been building hardware to test and prove their technology works in space; satellites to measure weather on Earth or in the Solar System; study the Sun and perform other science experiments. Ready, set, deploy Ariane 6 launch animation Access the video Four deployers, including the multi-CubeSat deployers RAMI and EXOpod, will release satellites away from the Ariane 6 upper stage. The two reentry capsules and nine satellites that are set to fly free are placed at the top of the rocket in order of their release, perfectly timed to be set on their way after leaving their Ariane 6 nest, 600 km above Earth. Cubesat deployers are like mini launchers in their own right, orchestrating a series of spring-loaded ejections to shoot one or multiple miniature satellites from the Ariane launcher at the right time, speed and in the right direction to set them on their way. As the CubeSats don’t have their own propulsion, they will stay in the same orbit Ariane 6 releases them into. Many missions Not all the missions will fly free. One mission, YPSat, will stay attached to the upper stage of the Ariane 6 and record the mission. Four other experiments will remain fixed, performing their work for the duration of the rocket’s flight and returning altogether in unison, like skydivers holding tight for their Earth descent. Ariane 6 team at the launchpad “The first flight of a new rocket is always an astounding moment as there are hundreds of thousands of details that have to work in perfect harmony – for the first time together in full,” says Loïc Bourillet, head of ESA’s Collective Launch Service Procurement. “Rather than only launching an inert dummy payload as a stand in for larger satellites, we have a large platform that also offers a unique opportunity to accommodate smaller, data gathering payloads. I am incredibly pleased with the scale of space hardware that has been designed and built. It’s a testament to the inventive minds of our generation.” All eyes on Ariane 6 YPSat during mechanical testing ESA’s young professional satellite, YPSat, will take pictures and video of the Ariane 6 rocket itself once it flies free. Tatjana Mandil, a communications officer for YPSat during her work as a trainee engineer on lunar Gateway modules, said “A launcher’s first flight is always much anticipated and attracts lots of attention. It is going to be wild to know our team’s satellite is at the top of ESA’s new rocket, and we hope to add to the spectacle when we can share the video of the satellites releasing into Earth orbit.” Each passenger will be highlighted in an individual article over the next few months.

An innovative project funded by ESA through the Discovery element of its Basic Activities seeks to integrate satellite data about Earth’s surface with the Internet of Things and make this possible. Observing Earth from space provides essential information for monitoring climate change and improving agricultural practices. While satellite data are available for every square meter of our planet’s surface, they are not always easy to use for new services and business ideas. Researchers from the Linz Center of Mechatronics GmbH, Austria combined Earth observation and the Internet of Things (IoT) by dividing the surface of our planet into equally sized pixels.Each Pixel Twin is a treasure case containing data from Earth observation portals associated with a particular area and is identifiable and addressable with an IoT object. The grid of pixels, covering Earth’s full surface, will live within EU''s FIWARE IoT framework, which brings together data sources with the services built on top of them. Pixel Twins – integrating Earth’s surface into the internet of things The “Pixel Twins – integrating Earth’s surface into the internet of things” project was initially submitted through ESA’s Open Discovery Ideas Channel (OSIP).“We thought that ESA’s OSIP was the perfect opportunity to propose our idea”, says Leander Hörmann, Team Lead Industrial IoT at Linz Center of Mechatronics GmbH. “It led to an exceptionally good cooperation, and we received valuable feedback from the ESA team at all stages of the project. The constant exchange of project status and ideas for further development led to a meaningful project outcome.”"With the Discovery element of ESA''s Basic Activities we are focussing on identifying the most novel, potentially game changing ideas and funding the first steps to realise them, nurturing innovation in the European space sector," says Leopold Summerer, Head of the Advanced Concepts and Studies Office at ESA. "The Pixel Twins project is a prime example of how we can foster ground breaking ideas that have the potential to create new business opportunities." Why combine Earth observation with IoT? Combining ground-based and satellite information provides a more complex picture and overcomes the limitations of each data set. While satellites can easily collect data for large areas of the Earth, sometimes the surface is obstructed by clouds. Ground-based sensors are not affected by this aspect, but are able to monitor only small areas. Earth''s surface meets the Internet of Things “Remote sensing devices are very far from the object of the observation, and sometimes it is particularly useful to complement that with in situ sensors,” explains Bertrand Le Saux from ESA’s Phi-Lab, senior scientist and lead on this project. “What is very innovative is that Earth observation data have been put in the IoT framework, using all the capacity that are usually used in processing IoT data.”“Very precise but scattered data from the IoT side can enrich coarse data from the earth observation part, and it turns out a win-win situation. The overall result is a significantly increased data quality which enables new fields of applications”, he adds. From idea to smart farming The approach developed by the team has been applied to two use cases: smart faming and photovoltaics. “During the first phase of the project, we conducted a stakeholder workshop to identify the most interesting and promising use cases”, tells Leander.From the proposed ideas, the team selected the use cases with the best applicability. “The use cases should have a good possibility to combine Earth observation data with IoT data, and the selected application within the use-case should benefit significantly from the approach”, he adds. Budapest, Hungary In both cases, the researchers evaluated the approach on small test areas. “In the smart farming use case, we applied it to a vineyard in Hungary, where our IoT devices were installed during a European project,” explains Leander, “while in the photovoltaic use case, we applied it in the vicinity of local photovoltaic installations.”For smart farming applications, data about the greenness of the vegetation from Sentinel-2 satellite and IoT based have been combined together. As a result, these data sets are improved and continuously available. For the photovoltaics, potential improvements in the estimation of the energy potential at different geographical locations are possible.“We successfully demonstrated our approach in both cases,” says Leander, “and we demonstrated how satellite Earth observation data could be enhanced through the integration of IOT-based in-situ data. The Pixel Twins project is a good example of how combining different data sources enhances the possibilities across different application domains”.The new approach of Pixel Twins can support many new services and business in the future. “When scaled up, this project will be very impactful”, says Bertrand.“Results from the project have already been incorporated into thematically linked research project proposals, one of which has already been granted,” continues Leander. “We will use the Pixel Twins approach as one aspect of building digital skills for smart farming in Central Europe”.

Many people contributed to its success over the years and, in this series of conversations, some have shared their personal and professional experiences with Annia Domènech.For the fourth in the series, we talked with Camilla MacMillan-Hughes, former web editor for ESA’s Space Transportation directorate. Camilla MacMillan-Hughes "I was the editor for ESA’s Space Transportation (formerly ‘Launchers’) directorate working part time for nine years until March 2023, based at ESA ESTEC in the Netherlands.“One of my tasks was to write news articles and produce other media for the ESA web portal about Ariane 5, its launches and technical developments. It’s important to get the level of technical detail right, to appeal to rocket enthusiasts as well as the general public, and to make it interesting and understandable by an international audience.“I previously worked for the company that developed the software and user interface for the Jupiter Control Centre display system on the wall and consoles. As the technical writer there, I wrote the French user manuals for the system administrator and operators."Who doesn’t like watching a rocket launch? Rockets are magnificent and cool but everything has to be perfect before the ‘GO’ for launch is given. I liked to see the teams in the control room, their anticipation, concentration, then their relief and joy. Given Ariane 5’s stunning reliability it was easy to forget how much of an accomplishment every successful launch is – and how much it matters to these people. "Covering launches was always very exciting and a little nerve-racking too. When the Arianespace broadcast started I would have that feeling: the launch is beginning! ESA mission launches involved a whole team. There’s a great sense of camaraderie and belonging."But for most commercial launches, occurring in the early hours of the morning European time, there would only be a couple of us from Communications online. I’m a night owl so was happy to be covering these launches and publishing from home. My cat would love to join me and his paws often reached out onto my keyboard! Webb liftoff on Ariane 5 "It was exhilarating – the countdown, the roar of the Vulcain engine, and liftoff! After Arianespace announced launch success, I would publish my prepared ESA article and update background pages before going to bed."In the early days, the picture at the top of the article would be my screenshot taken at exactly eight seconds after the liftoff announcement as Ariane 5 left the ground (it was the best view in the frame of the TV broadcast and sometimes this could be tricky to capture as network technology was not what it is now)."Nowadays Europe’s Spaceport sends out beautiful high-resolution photos soon after liftoff. Of course, the best launches to watch were during the daytime, when there was a clear view and blue skies."One of the most intense launch campaigns for me was for the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope, which lifted off on Christmas Day in 2021. In the month leading up to launch, I published something every day about Ariane 5 and spaceport activities. What crowned it all was the perfect launch injection which saved fuel which will extend Webb’s expected lifetime. STS public events team in 2019 "As part of outreach, Ariane 5 was also an important part of ESA Open days. This was a chance to get together with some of my STS colleagues from HQ. Our stand had rocket models, posters, brochures and quizzes for kids. It was great fun to create the stand and meet the enthusiastic public.""Ariane 5 is an incredible feat of engineering and I’m very proud to have been part of the team helping the public to follow and understand its evolution."I never missed a launch in all the time I worked for Space Transportation. I have moved on from STS but am still keen to watch our European launchers lift off. The final Ariane 5 launch, for me, marked the end of an era." Ariane 5 had 117 successful launches and placed 239 satellites in orbit. The heavy launcher carried prominent payloads, such as ESA’s comet-chasing Rosetta mission, a dozen Galileo navigation satellites, the James Webb Space Telescope and recently Juice, the explorer of Jupiter and its icy moons.

PRETTY CubeSat with two patch antennas PRETTY’s main instrument is a new type of ‘reflectometry’ instrument, which uses the same type of satellite navigation signals our smartphones and cars rely on for directions, but in a very different way. PRETTY has twin patch antennas that it points towards Galileo and GPS navigation satellites visible ahead of it in space. These antennas gather signals coming both directly from the satellites and reflected off Earth’s surface. By precisely comparing these two signals using a technique called ‘interferometry’, PRETTY can calculate the range of the reflected signal, deriving altitude and other surface characteristics. PRETTY CubeSat''s first light “I’m amazed by the quality of the result, because this was basically the first time we turned on the software, since reaching orbit,” explains Andreas Dielacher of Beyond Gravity, who developed the signal processing core PRETTY uses. “Overall ground truth for this instrument is very limited; it’s not so long ago we made a field test campaign where we were pointing an antenna over a bridge in Vienna to measure the height of the Danube River. While our calculations and simulations predicted all would go well, unpredictable things can happen in space. But, with these first results, I’m left really impressed by the instrument’s performance.”At just 34 x 10 x 10 cm in size, the PRETTY, Passive REflecTometry and dosimeTrY, mission is a ‘3-unit’ CubeSat – a low-cost, standardised type of small satellite built up from 10 cm boxes. Funded through ESA’s General Support Technology Programme by Austria, PRETTY has been developed by an all-Austrian consortium, with Beyond Gravity Austria as prime contractor developing the reflectometry payload, Seibersdorf Laboratories contributing a radiation dosimeter payload and Technical University of Graz with overall responsibility for the satellite and operations. Vega VV23 liftoff PRETTY was launched on ESA’s Vega launcher last October into a 560 km altitude orbit. A prolonged commissioning phase followed, complicated by issues with the satellite’s pointing software and radio interference from other sources.“It’s taken a lot of effort to reach this point,” notes Camille Pirat, system engineer in ESA’s CubeSat Systems Unit and PRETTY’s technical officer. “We selected this location for our first light to show what the mission can do, and the results are indeed impressive. Now we are ready to gather more data, aiming to perform at least one new acquisition each day during nominal operations.” PRETTY is testing ''slant'' reflectometry ESA radiometer engineer Manuel Martin-Neira was the inventor of the reflectometry concept three decades ago, which is in use by multiple missions and constellations today, turning reflected satnav signals into a low-cost source of environmental information, especially wind and sea ice data. He explains that PRETTY works differently from typical reflectometry missions: “Standard reflectometry missions are based on signals that are reflected nearly straight up, while PRETTY relies on signals reflected sideways at a very shallow angle, known as ‘slant geometry’.“The original idea of using grazing reflections came from radio occultation, where the passage of satnav signals through the atmosphere is used to derive data on temperature and humidity vertical profiles. It was noted that signals bouncing off Earth’s surface at such angles remained much more coherent, so might be picked up using quite small antennas. PRETTY''s first light signal “To boost this coherence further, the decision was made based on ground testing to switch to using the E5/L5 signal band as transmitted by European Galileo and US GPS satellites. This is the first time this band has been employed for this kind of ‘interferometric’ reflectometry, but its lower frequency helps to account for the excellence of these first results.”Most conventional reflectometry missions operate by checking reflected satnav signals against locally generated copies. The problem with this technique is that accuracy is limited to the level of positioning coded into the signal – for instance the most secure class of signals remain off limits to non-governmental users. PRETTY team with CubeSat Interferometry, by contrast, involves cross-checking entire signals – rather than the ranging information coded into them – so ends up as more precise. PRETTY is designed to employ both methods, so will be able to cross-check their relative effectiveness.PRETTY’s first light signal track begins with strong reflectivity, which decreases further along as the sea ice gets older, rougher and potentially giving way to open water – so instead of a single reflecting surface there are multiple reflections, like a shattered mirror. PRETTY''s second light, over Greenland Andreas explains: “The track passes over a small island, at which point we have a steep change in elevation which leads us to losing acquisition for a short stretch, as the signal goes outside of our observation window. That comes down to the relative coarseness of the digital elevation model being used, but the acquisition is acquired again as we cross back into the sea.”Manuel adds: “For our second observation we similarly lose track as the coverage passes from sea ice north of Greenland onto Greenland itself. But we do resume coverage on top of the Greenland ice sheet. So in principle we should be able to observe over the Antarctic ice sheets as well.”As more data are gathered, the results will be cross checked against other reflectometry and conventional altimetry missions, to test the limits of this new Earth-observing method. PRETTY was ESA’s first reflectometry mission to be approved, although was beaten into orbit by the Spanish-made FSSCat CubeSats. The next ESA reflectometry mission, HydroGNSS, will focus on land observation, including soil moisture,biomass, freeze-thaw soils and inundation areas. ESA''s HydroGNSS reflectometry mission PRETTY’s second instrument is also up and running. This miniaturised dosimeter for space radiation, SATDOS, will operate throughout its mission to give an authoritative space radiation map of low-Earth orbit.Christoph Tscherne, PRETTY project manager at Seibersdorf Laboratories comments: “We are thrilled to witness the ''first light'' of SATDOS aboard PRETTY, which marks a significant milestone in our mission to monitor radiation levels and their effects in orbit to ensure the reliability of satellite systems in space. So far, we have analyzed five hours of initial data, covering more than three cycles around the satellite''s 560 km sun-synchronous orbit. This data clearly confirm the functionality of all the dosimetry sensors onboard SATDOS and signals our readiness to to move into the science phase of the mission.” Space radiation Manuela Wenger, PRETTY project manager at TU Graz, adds: “Everyone put in a lot of effort to verify the functionality of the entire platform with its various modules and analyse and tune all necessary parameters – especially of the attitude control system – to create an optimal starting point for the payload operations. It is truly uplifting when all team members work long and hard toward a goal and despite some obstacles ultimately succeed in gathering the first light.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

However it takes real-time guidance from experts on the ground to acquire medically useful ultrasound images. Once astronauts travel to the Moon or further into the Solar System such guidance will no longer be practical due to the time delay involved. A new ESA-led project aims to leverage AI and Machine Learning so that astronauts can perform close to expert quality ultrasound exams by themselves. Ultrasound exam on ISS “The success of crewed exploration comes down to the health and safety of our astronauts,” explains ESA biomedical engineer Arnaud Runge, overseeing the project. “As missions venture further into space that becomes something that is harder to ensure because the number and skills of crewmembers will be limited. Therefore we need technological assistance to make future crews less and less dependent on Earth-based expertise”Living in a constrained volume in the sustained absence of gravity while being exposed to high levels of radiation can affect many critical organs, as well as leading to balance disorders, fluid shifts, alterations in visual functioning, cardiovascular deconditioning, decreased immune function, muscle atrophy and bone loss. In addition, future planetary missions might lead to injuries during surface operations. ALISSE user interface The good news is that most of these conditions can be monitored using ultrasound imaging, relying on echoes from sound beyond the hearing range of our ears to open windows into the soft tissues of the human body. The bad news is it requires years of training to make someone proficient in performing an ultrasound exam.“Ultrasound imaging has already become an essential diagnostic tool for International Space Station crews,” comments Carlos Illana of GMV in Spain, the company leading the project consortium for ESA. “But in the current practice on ISS, the astronaut who is applying the ultrasound device to their crewmate is either receiving real-time guidance from an experienced ultrasound operator down on the ground or performs the investigations based on the limited training received prior to the mission.” Remotely-operated ultrasound exam Arnaud adds: “To overcome this challenge, ESA has previously worked on the concept of robotised tele-ultrasound, where the expert radiologist on Earth was remotely piloting remotely the ultrasound probe aboard the ISS. However, while interesting for utilisation on the ISS as well as for terrestrial applications, this approach also has limitations: Indeed, once crewed missions extend beyond Earth orbit into deep space such guidance will no longer be feasible, because the greater distance from Earth gives rise to an increased time-lag in communications, while bandwidth will be constrained as well.”There is therefore a need for solutions providing crew with more autonomy.In response, ESA’s Autonomous uLtrasound Image Improvement SyStEM, ALISSE, offers astronauts the on-the-spot ability to capture diagnostic quality ultrasound images as if they were expert radiologists, thanks to the assistance of AI and machine learning. ALISSE can identify organs from straight and side-on views Collaborating with the project, the Nuclear Physics Group of the Universidad Complutense Madrid devised new techniques for ultrasound simulation and image synthesis while the Emergency and Urgency Radiology Service of La Paz Hospital in Madrid provided guidance in ultrasound examinations and pathologies, as well as the provision and labelling of hundreds of thousands of anonymised ultrasound scans, used for training the deep learning neural network that underlies the ALISSE system.Arnaud adds: “La Paz is the biggest hospital in Spain, performing more than half a million ultrasound examinations per year in the Emergency Service alone, using more than 40 different device models. We used an active learning mechanism to filter out non-interesting images, leaving less than 2% that the Radiology Service selected and labelled for our Neural Network Training Subsystem to be trained on.” ISS in orbit over Nile Delta This amounts to a huge quantity of curated images of more than 50 000 patients per organ, including plenty of examples of ‘pathological’ – or diseased – cases. For the initial ALISSE protype the consortium explored kidneys and bladders, as very representative abdominal organs which are not easy to scan, related to common astronaut diseases such as stone formation and urinary retention.David Mirault of GMV says: “As we developed the system, ESA flight surgeons gave us essential feedback and guidance. Our aim was to make the user interface as intuitive as possible, so we had a group of entirely untrained physics students try out using it. Ultrasound images are noisy, blurry and contain plenty of artifacts such as shadows and speckle noise, and everyone’s body is different. So medical professionals need years of specific courses and training to learn this diagnostic technique for a single organ. This means the chances of an untrained novice performing a successful ultrasound exam are essentially zero.” Applying AI to ultrasound exams However ALISSE users receive detailed guidance of where in the body to place the ultrasound wand, are provided with example images of the target organ and given the percentage likelihood of the object in view being the correct target. The system is also able to differentiate between the clinically valuable long ways ‘plane detection mode’ for an organ versus a less useful ‘transverse’ side view.Jon Scott, supporting the project at the European Astronaut Centre, comments: ‘The end results are very encouraging; nine out of ten of the ALISSE-assisted students’ images were clinically acceptable ultrasound standard planes of kidneys and bladders, approaching the performance of a trained radiologist. And as an added benefit, ALISSE can also work with multiple ultrasound devices, maximising its flexibility and reducing the barriers to its implementation. The result is a system that allows astronauts to take more responsibility for their own medical care, an essential feature for the future of space medicine, and should also democratise the use of ultrasound imaging back on Earth. With the continued development of this technology, we can look forward to a time when frontline medical partitioners can employ AI-guided ultrasound devices as proficiently as they collect blood samples today.”The ALISSE project was supported through ESA’s Technology Development Element, fostering promising new technologies for space. As a next step, the consortium plans to increase the system’s support to other organs and improve guidance instructions to make ALISSE even more intuitive. ESA is also interested in having the ALISSE system working on a tablet connected to an ultrasound probe. Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Spain’s PLD Space launched the Miura 1 suborbital mission from southern Spain last year, and it is already working on a larger, orbital class launch vehicle, the Miura 5. In-depth In October 2023 PLD Space inaugurated the suborbital launch vehicle Miura1 from the El Arenosillo Test Centre in Spain. The rocket is designed to send up to 100 kg up to heights of 150 km above Earth, offering short periods of weightlessness for researchers and other customers. Miura 1 launch Miura 5 is the next step in PLD Space launch services portfolio targeting customers who want to launch small satellites into orbit. Set to launch up to 540 kg of hardware to a sun-synchronous orbit, Miura 5 is bigger in every way to Miura 1. The future rocket will be 2 m in diameter and have two stages to propel payloads to orbit – the first stage will eventually be recuperated with parachutes for reuse on later flights. Modular Miura 5 Miura 1 liftoff The contract signed today by ESA and PLD Space supports the Miura 5 launch service development by co-funding to the value of €1.3 million to develop a modular, customisable, payload accommodation system. Designed to release all types of satellites with as much flexibility as possible, the payload system – called MOSPA for Modular Solution for Payload Adapter – will allow PLD Space to offer its customers a wider range of missions and services, including accommodation of CubeSats, nanosatellites and microsatellites. The development of the modular payload adapter will be done in partnership with OCCAM Space.The goal is to create the hardware to be as light as possible while also being as adaptable as possible to launch more satellites and meet market demands.“PLD space has proven itself with its first launch last year, and we look forward to seeing the experience applied to the Miura 5 launch services development,” says ESA''s Jorgen Bru, “The payload adapter development engaged today was chosen to increase market competitiveness and ensure that many different types of satellites and customers can fly.” Miura 5 PLD Space’s Chief Business Development Office Raúl Verdú adds, “The winning of the Boost! contract, an achievement shared with our partner OCCAM Space, is a further testament to this fact, and another vote of confidence from ESA. We are excited to develop a modular, highly flexible, low-cost solution to meet our customers’ accommodation needs aboard Miura 5.”“OCCAM Space team has a large expertise in structures and mechanisms in the space sector. We are very happy that our MOSPA philosophy and design has been selected to complement the Miura 5 upper stage.

A GSTP funded activity investigated how the capabilities of AR and VR could be leveraged to improve the remote maintenance and support of ground station equipment and telescopes. ESA’s Tracking Station Network – ESTRACK – is a global system of ground stations, providing vital communication between all space assets and the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC). These ground stations are distributed globally, often in remote, hard to reach places, where it can be difficult to perform the mission specific maintenance and updates.Using a conventional, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) tablet and an AR headset, a proof-of-concept prototype was developed. Here, a local on-site operator can work together with a remote expert, following live instructions through AR/VR tablets or hand’s free, in-situ digital platform, where drawings and descriptions are available within the engineer’s field of view. AR is effective is superimposing digital information onto the physical world. VR, by comparison, creates a more, fully immersive, computer-generated environment. The remote expert can interact with the local on-site operator’s environment digitally; highlighting specific objects, points of interest and annotating them if needed. Additionally, explanatory three-dimensional models, instruction manuals, task lists and procedures are available and displayed through the headset’s optical see-through.The protype successfully demonstrated how both AR and VR can be used to support the remote inspection and maintenance of ground stations and telescope operations. The technology readiness level of the prototype was successfully raised to 5 (breadboard validation in a relevant environment). Validation occurred at the Ground Segment Reference Facility (ESOC GSRF). The next step is to deploy and test the protype technology in a specific ground station or telescope facility, and eventually operational deployment.A similar solution could also be used for telemedicine and/or in the automotive and aeronautical industry, where the set-up and/or maintenance of expensive, complex and remote hardware is involved. Additional space-based user cases could include, for example, remote research stations, spacecraft validation test and astronaut crew support.Contract 4000136086 closed in 2022.

While manufacturing of spherical and aspherical surfaces can be performed using established technologies, the manufacturing and testing of free-form surfaces poses challenges to polishing companies. In recent years, polishing techniques were developed for free-form mirrors but only to a limited extent for refractive elements.Transferring and developing figuring, polishing and testing techniques for free-form lenses of high quality will enable more compact refractive instruments for Earth observation and science. The activity aims to develop technologies for the figuring and polishing for arbitrarily shaped refractive surfaces (lenses). The development was driven by the need to achieve a low surface form error, low mid spatial frequency errors and low surface roughness.This TDE activity (T716-603MM), with Ústav fyziky plazmatu AV ČR, v.v.i. (CZ), was able to define a successful manufacturing process for the realization of both the free-form and the aspherical elements, which met the requirement for surface form error (SFE) on both Fused Silica and CaF2 materials and the requirement for micro-roughness for the Fused Silica material.The proposed manufacturing processes enable optical engineers to realize high-performance optical systems while minimizing the mass and volume. At the same time, the low micro-roughness level brings the key benefit for systems where low stray light level plays a key role.

Deployable telescope within shipping container Formally part of the Agency’s Optics and Optoelectronics Laboratory, the station will serve as a flexible testbed for optical telecommunications hardware and systems. ETOGS can also support other activities that require looking at the sky with a telescope or pointing skyward with a laser, such as space debris monitoring or orbit determination via laser ranging.ETOGS consists of a standard 6-m (20 ft) long shipping container, customised to host an 80-cm diameter telescope on a lifting platform and a climate-controlled operator area. Laser transmitters, receivers and other required equipment can be attached to this flexible structure to serve each specific campaign. Hauled by lorry, the station can be deployed wherever needed and powered via a mains attachment, diesel generator or a solar-powered battery assembly. Telescope raised to the roof of ETOGS Responding to optical communications prioritiesESA optoelectronics Engineer Jorge Piris explains: “This station has really been created in response to the needs of the fast-developing optical communications community for a flexible testbed than can be deployed on a representative on-ground environment. One of the most relevant questions in optical communications is to what extent might the surrounding environment affect the quality of the link – such as background light in urban areas, or atmospheric turbulence due to weather.“This is most crucial when it comes to receiving signals from quantum communications systems, since the quantity of light involved is extremely low, with the information transmitted via individual photons. With this station we can really start to answer these questions by operating from numerous different locations. By providing our partners with a ready test platform like this, we support hardware validation and iteration without the high development costs of a dedicated ground station.” Quantum key distribution from space Light-based messaging enables quantum leap in securityOptical and quantum technologies promise to revolutionise connectivity on a global scale. By using pulses of light with a much higher frequency than radio waves, optical communication enables the transfer of more data per given instant. Optical communications through fibre optic cables underpins the modern terrestrial internet infrastructure, but links with satellites remain largely dependent on lower-frequency, lower-bandwidth radio waves.And by exploiting the quantum properties of light, systems such as ‘quantum key distribution’ will help safeguard data at to a previously inconceivable degree; the security of the exchange of cryptographic keys is safeguarded by the physical properties of light particles, making messaging resilient to eavesdropping by bad actors. NASA''s Psyche mission Jorge adds: “The station’s 80 cm telescope is the baseline size envisioned for quantum key distribution on a commercial scale, so we anticipate the station being used for the demonstration and validation of satellite-based quantum communications.”Shining a light into deep spaceThe first operational mission for this new ESA asset will be to support the deep space optical communication demonstration with NASA’s Psyche mission scheduled for 2025. Kryoneri Observatory, Greece. ESA is collaborating with a European consortium and the National Observatory of Athens to develop and deploy ETOGS at Kryoneri Observatory in Greece to host a multi-beam Ground Laser Transmitter.The objective is to uplink a powerful infrared laser signal of up to 7kW, enabling the onboard laser terminal of NASA’s Psyche spacecraft to point back to Earth in turn. This link will cover unprecedented distances of up to 2.7 astronomical units – circa 403 million km – to mark a new era for optical communications in deep space. Observing from the roof of ETOGS ETOG’s container has been built by WtW in Germany, with its telescope coming from Astrosysteme Austria. The remaining elements to complete an operational system will come largely from project and activity deliverables. Jorge notes: “One of the exciting parts of this project is putting together the various deliverables from different projects into a single set-up, then demonstrating their synergy to work as a system.”For now, ETOGS is being equipped at ESA’s ESTEC technical centre in the Netherlands. The OOEL Lab team will use its telescope to acquire images of the International Space Station and other satellites, to validate the station has the required stability and tracking capability. ETOGS looking skyward Later this year ETOGS, with the deep space laser transmitter mounted on it, will be tested from Kryoneri in Greece using ESA’s Alphasat satellite in geostationary orbit at 36 000 km altitude, which is equipped with an optical communications system.Once operational, the station will operate as part of the OOEL Lab, so will be at the disposal of ESA projects as well as companies and research institutions of Agency Member States.The station has been developed and is being run by ESA’s Opto-Electronics section, which is dedicated to systems that utilise or control light.

These physics-based models have been developed to simulate parts of the Sun-to-Earth system, which consist of plasma, magnetic fields and energetic charged particles.“Space weather, akin to Earth''s weather, is governed by dynamic phenomena with storms becoming more frequent and severe when the Sun is more active. Solar activity is currently approaching the peak of its approximately 11-year cycle. However, unlike traditional weather, space weather processes are governed by charged particles and induced magnetic fields instead of viscosity and aerodynamic turbulence,” explains Piers Jiggens, the Technical Officer for the activity and part of ESA’s Space Environment and Effects section.A recent advancement funded by GSTP and led by KU Leuven, Belgium, on heliospheric modelling techniques is paving the way for a new system of coupled models for forecasting space weather in more timely and accurate ways, improving our understanding of how storms evolve and preparation for the unpredictable events occurring between the sun and Earth.Initially models are developed in the form of scientific codes but require additional technical development before they can transition for use in operations. As part of the activity three key modelling assets have been matured and refined for operational use, focusing on the region between the Sun and Earth''s magnetosphere. The first, named COCONUT, is a cutting-edge magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, providing a more advanced and reliable solution for the solar corona. The second model, Icarus, takes the simulation from the solar corona to Earth, using Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) to automatically focus processing power on areas of interest, such as eruptions called Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and the shocks the induce, crucial for real-time forecasting. The third model, PARADISE, simulates high-energy particles accelerated by these coronal mass ejections, enabling the prediction of space storms. Space weather effects One of the challenges the project addressed is the acceleration of particles by CMEs, with a focus on predicting the most energetic particles arriving in radiation storms as these pose the most significant hazard. Coronal mass ejections in extreme cases may propagate to the Earth in less than 24 hours, whilst accelerated particles may arrive in 30 minutes from the time of the solar eruption. The ability to simulate these events quickly is crucial for timely predictions.The final part of the activity involved coupling these models in ESA’s Virtual Space Weather Modelling Centre (VSWMC), part of the Space Weather Network managed by ESA’s Space Weather office based in ESOC, Germany."The VSWMC gathers simulation models from the Sun''s surface, heliosphere and up to the Earth''s magnetosphere and even upper atmosphere. It enables forecasts in the service of end-users - satellite operators, human spaceflight or ground power operators, or scientific teams – based on coupled model chains, transferring plasma data from one to the next - and in some cases bi-directionally - in order to perform simulations though the whole solar system and eventually provide accurately and rapidly forecast data at the points of interest, spacecraft of planet" explains Grégoire Déprez, also working in ESA’s Space Environment and Effects section. What is space weather? The results of the activity so far have been promising, with the final stages of validation underway. The focus is on forecasting space weather events, especially those involving high-energy particles that can pose radiation hazards to spacecraft and humans.Validation of these models is ongoing and researchers are working to resolve past space weather events, ensuring the models would have simulated them in the same way they played out. The ultimate goal is to update operational systems, making these advanced forecasting capabilities available to space weather experts across Europe.

The spacecraft comes in two parts, an orbital module that supplies everything it needs to fly around our planet and a reentry module that brings Space Rider and its experiments back to Earth. Read the full manual Space Rider user guide The Space Rider manual provides an overview of the vehicle, its services and various mission scenarios. The manual gives users high-level knowledge and allows potential future users to plan for commercial mission opportunities. It is available to download, print and archive for anyone who wants to use the spacecraft in the future, or even if you just want to say you’ve read a spacecraft manual.The document ends with details on the vehicle and technical aspects for the payloads.If you want to know which communication protocols are supported, or how many GB of data can be downloaded a day, how many G’s it will pull, how much humidity to expect during transport and launch or the expected radiation to be received in space, you will find it in the user guide.The user update includes more details on ground controls and landing site operations, finalised values for interfaces and working environments, new sections on payload designs and integration and an annex with a mission timeline. Payload perfection Space Rider Space Rider is designed for payloads, putting experiments and more into space and returning them to Earth. The manual expands on how customer payloads can be connected to Space Rider. These can be over a cubic meter in size and up to 600 kg. The payloads can be contained or exposed to space and even have a view of Earth as Space Rider flies around our planet.Scientists, engineers and customers will have last-minute access to their equipment on Space Rider with a lean operational approach, and technical flexibility in the runup to launch. Putting it in practice Space Rider is Europe''s reusable space transportation system As future users get acquainted with the spacecraft, the Space Rider teams are getting ready for the first real-life tests this year.Space Rider uses a novel technique for braking from its orbital speeds of 28 800 km/h to a soft landing on a dedicated runway, soon to be built at Europe’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. Returning from Earth orbit at supersonic speeds, Space Rider will release a parafoil at around 5 km altitude and steer itself automatically to a soft landing.Tests on a smaller parafoil will start in Spain first, with larger scale tests on the full 70-m2 parafoil afterwards. The smaller tests will allow engineers to tweak the algorithms that will pilot the spacecraft using winches to pull and release the canopy – just like a human paraglider pilot does.

To simplify oversight of ESA’s coming double-satellite Proba-3 mission, its team is making sure controllers will obtain visualisations of the satellites’ relative positions in real time. Solar corona Scheduled for launch together this September, the Proba-3 pair will fly in orbit relative to one another down to millimetre scale precision. This will allow one to cast a precisely controlled shadow onto the other, in the process eclipsing the fiery disc of the Sun to reveal its faint surrounding corona for sustained observations.“The Proba-3 satellites will maintain formation in this way on an autonomous basis for up to six hours per orbit,” explains Damien Galano, ESA’s Proba-3 mission manager. “But at other periods during each highly elliptical 19-hour orbit – during which the pair fly from their closest 600 km from Earth all the way to a hundred times further out – active human oversight will indeed become essential.” Proba-3 satellites acquiring formation, simulated in VTS Access the video “As we developed the initial simulator system it quickly became clear that we couldn’t just rely on the numbers we’d get back from the satellites’ telemetry. Typically what you get is their position stated in three coordinates amounting to the X, Y and Z axes, but it’s impossible for the human brain to translate that fast enough; we can’t work solely with an incoming stream of numbers.“Even more importantly for maintaining double satellite control, we need to get an instant sense of exactly how the two platforms are oriented towards each other – for instance, is the shadow being cast in the right location, is the laser pointed directly? The telemetry could eventually give us a few graphs showing these variables, but we realised that what we needed was an immediate snapshot portraying the satellites’ dynamics and trajectories.” Proba-3 will be controlled from Redu in Belgium To perform the real-time 2D and 3D visualisations the Proba-3 team realised they required, they turned to the VTS (Visualization Tool for Space data) software which is licenced freeware owned by French space agency CNES and developed by the Spacebel company in Belgium.“VTS is not actually a visualisation tool as such,” explains Proba-3 system and software engineer Esther Bastida Pertegaz. “It is a means of centralising multiple applications on a seamless time-synchronised basis, including visualisation software, with the freeware space simulator Celestia included as its baseline.” Proba-3 Coronagraph spacecraft simulated in VTS Regularly updated, VTS has been employed by numerous European space missions in the past, typically help plan complex manoeuvres and acquiring images for a given region of Earth or other planetary bodies.Esther explains: “What is really new for Proba-3 is that we have developed a code forging a real-time link between VTS and the incoming telemetry – for now from the simulator but eventually from the actual satellites – so the operator gets an intuitive sense of the two satellites with a single glance.” Proba-3 Occulter spacecraft simulated in VTS Having begun employing VTS for testing out Proba-3’s mission simulator, as a next step the team will soon be extending its use to start training Proba-3 operators, who will oversee the satellite pair from ESA’s Redu centre in Belgium. Then, once the mission begins flight, VTS will also be integrated into their control infrastructure.“The controllers will not be overseeing the satellites continuously,” adds Esther. “But for example, when the satellites are at perigee, or their closest point to Earth, VTS will ingest the telemetry that estimates their orbital tracks out to 60 530 km away, so the controllers will be able to look at a glance and see if there is any problem that needs to be corrected, for instance if the satellites will come too close to one another or venture too far away.” Proba-3 satellites The first version of VTS was released in 2007 but has received regular upgrades since then, incorporating bundled applications including various visualisation and plotting tools. It has been used in many major space missions including ESA’s ATV ‘space trucks’ to the International Space Station, the Rosetta comet chaser and its Philae lander, Europe’s Copernicus Sentinel-3 Earth observation mission and the forthcoming Japanese-German Mars Moon Exploration mission, serving to visualise the orbits of Phobos and Deimos around the Red Planet.Part of the attraction of VTS is that it can be deployed in an operator’s computers on an entirely separate basis, so it reads the data coming from other systems without any risk of disrupting them if it were to go wrong. “Versatile and user-friendly, VTS has been used in a multitude of contexts, demonstrating its adaptability across different stages and aspects of space missions,” notes Thomas Crosnier of CNES. “This ranges from pre-project mission design and simulations through to operational mission planning and flight dynamics both around Earth and further out into the Solar System. And as space missions become more complex, VTS has kept pace with additional capabilities and features. We’re proud that ESA’s Proba-3 has become the latest space mission to utilise VTS.” Information loop for real-time visualisation in VTS Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

But currently no operational W-band satellite communication system has been developed. As W-band can be considered a frontier for space telecommunication applications the development of high power devices for the final amplification stage is critical to manage the trade-off between power efficiency, spectral efficiency and robustness against link distortions. An activity with the University of Strathclyde, UK and TDE has developed a high-power W-band traveling wave tube and tested its RF performance. Various options were considered for the interaction waveguide. Helix and related technology were discounted since it was felt that the sizes were already extremely challenging in the Ka band, and scaling to significantly higher frequency was unattractive. Coupled cavity type approaches were considered but would not be consistent with the ESA targets for bandwidth required for communication applications and would likely be difficult to machine and join the delicate detailed structures at such high frequency.A range of alternative schemes were therefore considered. Metamaterials show promise as do a range of interdigital and comb schemes – however these are relatively undeveloped and brought high risk for a number of different reasons. Folded waveguide methods seemed likely to offer the power and bandwidth required for the communications applications and therefore work focused on this method. It brings the attractive feature of allowing machining in two halves using precision milling – this could eliminate aspects of the uncertainty which tends to impact helix type designs, in unit to unit reproducibility since it would remove one aspect dependent on skilled artisan work – the build of the delay line. The activity designed a folded waveguide structure, manufactured it by micro-milling the two halves and diffusion bonding them together before setting up a test bench for W-Band cold test measurements. Currently, the activity is not capable of producing a tight vacuum in the tube (it leaks at the braze joins between waveguide tapers and tube body and at the windows.)

No view of our Pale Blue Dot seen from deep space or our changing climate and planet seen from orbit. No samples from asteroids, no chance of deflecting them. No planetary flybys. No astronauts. No future on Mars or the Moon. No future in space. In-depth As the USA and the Soviet Union first launched satellites into orbit in the late 1950s, Europe''s space programme also began to take shape. Today, still, at the heart of Europe’s space ambitions, is the need to reach the stars: reliably, affordably and autonomously. In the last decades, ESA and European industry have designed, developed and delivered a range of rockets that have given ESA’s Member States a direct line to space. Together with France’s space agency CNES, a launch site in French Guiana was built from where they fly, boosted by its proximity to Earth’s equator and given a shove by Earth’s spin. ESA’s Space Transportation Directorate is both at the forefront of space exploration and behind the scenes investing in and supporting European business, academia and institutions, so that all Europeans continue to learn about and benefit from the cosmos. Here’s what we’re up to: Ariane 6 Ariane 6 launch animation Access the video Ariane 6 is Europe’s newest heavy-lift rocket, following in the footsteps of its incredibly successful and reliable predecessor, Ariane 5. Designed to inject satellites into a wide variety of orbits, it will be unprecedented in its versatility: Ariane 6 can put any satellite or payload into any orbital path, and even multiple on a single trip. Its design is modular, meaning for each flight the rocket can be adapted to the needs of its passengers. Over time, Ariane 6 can integrate new technologies and components to suit the future needs of the satellite industry and our evolving requirements as we continue to explore space. Cost-effective compared to its Ariane 5, it will launch more often and be flexible enough to send individual bespoke satellites to orbit as well as batches of satellites for constellations.Mission complete, the Ariane 6 upper stage can either reenter through Earth''s atmosphere to burn up, or reorbit to enter a ‘graveyard orbit’ – out of the way of other missions and ensuring it never becomes space debris. Vega-C Vega-C liftoff Vega-C is Europe’s nimble, flexible rocket for launching a wide range of missions. An evolution of Vega, which has delivered missions to space for a decade, including dozens of Earth observation satellites that have given us insights like never before into our changing planet. The new medium-lift Vega-C launcher offers improved performance, efficiency and versatility. It can put into orbit cargo in a mix of shapes and sizes, enhancing Europe’s independent capability to access space and meeting institutional, scientific, commercial and small satellite market needs. Space Rider Space Rider animation Access the video Europe’s future reusable space laboratory, Space Rider, will provide uncrewed trips to low-Earth orbit – and back. About the size of two minivans, Space Rider will stay in orbit for roughly two months while experiments unfold and new technologies are validated in the cargo bay, then return its cargo to Earth by landing with a guided parachute on a runway to be unloaded, refurbished and launched for another flight. Space Rider’s first flight is scheduled for 2025 on a Vega-C rocket, launching and landing from Europe''s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. Future Launchers Preparatory Programme Europe’s future of space travel Access the video What will the rockets of the future look like? Where will they go and how will they get there? These are the questions being addressed by ESA''s Future Launchers Preparatory Programme. ‘FLPP’ oversees research activities and studies to ensure European rockets of the future will deliver high performance and reliability for ESA, European national space agencies, universities, institutions and businesses without breaking the bank. Because without a doubt, Europe needs its own way of getting to orbit and has an important role in shaping our future in space. Boost! Boost! graphic Besides the developments undertaken by ESA, a great number of private initiatives across Europe are seeking to develop and deploy competitive commercial space transportation services. With the Boost! Programme, ESA is reaching out to those private entrepreneurs to provide them with tailored and flexible support to get these services off the ground. Boost! puts technical expertise, facilities, co-funding, networking and more right at the fingertips of private space transportation service providers, as well as providing assistance to ESA Member States establishing spaceports and testing infrastructure and related services. Boost! is also teaming up with the European Commission to implement the European Flight Ticket Initiative, acting as an ‘anchor customer’ for new European launch services at the benefit of ready-to-fly ‘in-orbit demonstration/validation’ satellite operators. In doing all this, ESA is ensuring that Europe is not only continuing to maintain its independent access to space but is boosting the future of space transportation through supporting the burgeoning private space economy. Europe''s Spaceport Ariane 6 launch complex at Europe''s Spaceport Europe''s gateway to space is situated in French Guiana, in the northeast of South America. In 1964, the French Government chose Kourou as their preferred site from where they would launch satellites into space. When ESA came into being in 1975, the French Government shared its Centre Spatial Guyanais with ESA, with the Agency funding upgrades to the facilities in preparation for the Ariane rocket series. Since then, ESA has continued to fund two-thirds of the spaceport''s annual budget as well as new facilities, now focusing on the newest rockets Ariane 6 and Vega-C. Facing the ocean, a large range of launch trajectories can be chosen from the east to the north without risk to the local population, and with no risk of cyclones or earthquakes the site is safe and protected. Work is currently underway to modernise the site, preparing it for the future and reducing as much as possible its impact on the local environment and our changing climate.

The success of the ground-based prototype and collaborative efforts set the stage for testing the IMPERIAL printer in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station, marking a significant leap in in-space manufacturing capabilities. In-depth In a leap towards the future of space manufacturing, a TDE activity has developed the IMPERIAL 3D printer, a groundbreaking technology designed to print parts much larger than the available printer building volume. Overcoming the limitations of conventional 3D printing processes, this innovation holds the key to reshaping how structures, tools and spare parts are produced for future long-term manned missions.IMPERIAL has been crafted with extraterrestrial manufacturing in mind, paving the way for astronauts to print essential components as needed during their missions. IMPERIAL: 3D printing’s new dimension Access the video The IMPERIAL Printer, was borne out of a previous ESA activity, called MELT and stands out due to its ability to overcome a significant limitation of conventional 3D printers while meeting the fabrication requirements of the International Space Station (ISS). One of the key improvements on the previous printers is its ability to print continuously without stopping. Traditional printers are confined by the size of their interior, meaning they can only print parts smaller than the printing volume offered by the printer chamber. IMPERIAL introduces a game-changing feature: a temperature-controlled conveyor belt. This belt allows parts to be printed without any limitation in one direction exploiting the conveyor belt mechanism and revolutionising the possibilities for creating structures in space. In microgravity conditions, the need to wrap printed parts is eliminated as they will not fold, streamlining the manufacturing process.“It can all be printed now. We are able to print functional parts, especially tools, and interface them with counterparts already onboard the ISS, we can process different materials, such as electrically conductive polymers for small CubeSat components and enclosing or the structure of very large items, such as telescopes. Now we can print anything which needs to withstand the harsh environment of space” explains Francesco Caltavituro, a space and systems engineer at OHB who worked on the project. “It can all be printed, especially if you want to use high-performance thermoplastics (PEI, PEEK and PEKK), this printer can handle them.”With great advancements often come great challenges. High-performance polymers, chosen for their exceptional mechanical and thermal properties, became the materials of choice for in-space and on-planet printing using the IMPERIAL printer. The MELT printer laid the groundwork by developing a 3D printer capable of printing high-performances structural materials like thermoplastic polymers under ISS microgravity conditions, producing functional parts and standard mechanical samples successfully. Printing large parts for in-space construction introduces thermal processing challenges, particularly when using these demanding high-performance thermoplastics. To overcome this, the Industry Team under ESA guidance implemented a precise heating system to maintain a uniform temperature within the chamber and also outside it, along the conveyor belt mechanism, crucial for printing homogenous parts with materials like these, avoiding undesired shrinkage and warping. Additionally, the innovative approach of printing on a movable belt requires careful consideration in terms of quality estimation for the manufactured parts. The prototype breadboard built for the project encompasses various subsystems, including the core printing components, a thermo-mechanical housing based on the EDR Experiment Insert (EI) dimensions, and a raw material distribution subsystem. This so called “breadboard” tackled these challenges by printing demonstrator parts that serve a dual purpose: providing practical evidence of in-situ manufacturing advantages over Earth-resupply and showcasing manufacturing without build volume constraints. 3D printing, as long as you like So far an unconfined beam, slider, connector and a socket wrench have all been chosen to illustrate the functionality and flexibility of the IMPERIAL printer''s design.Furthermore, manifolds have been printed in series to provide evidence of the second possible application of the technology demonstrated by the IMPERIAL project: the possibility to print items in batches or series without stop the production process in order to remove the samples from the print bed.The collaborative effort behind this groundbreaking and cutting-edge project involved a consortium led by OHB System AG in Germany as prime contractor, with Azimut Space in Germany, Athlone Institute of Technology in the Republic of Ireland, and BEEVERYCREATIVE in Portugal playing pivotal roles in developing the 3D printer. The successful completion of the ground-based prototype sets the stage for the next critical phase: testing the IMPERIAL printer in the microgravity environment of the International Space Station (ISS) or onboard alternatives microgravity platforms such us the ESA Space Rider. While the technology is mature enough to undertake these trials, nothing is planned as of yet. The breadboard, or prototype, for the printer has been meticulously designed for integration into the European Drawer Rack Mark 2 (EDR MKII) facility aboard the ISS, ensuring compliance with essential resources such as power, cooling, and, crucially, dimensions. Further GSTP activities related to Advanced Manufacturing at OHB Ins and outs of 3D printing As part of its commitment to advancing space technologies, the General Support Technology Programme (GSTP) is engaged in a series of innovative activities in the realm of advanced manufacturing, not least those part of its Advanced Manufacturing framework. One notable GSTP project, developed in synergy with Dr. Marco Mulser and his team at OHB System AG as well as external partners, involves the maturation of Additive Manufacturing technologies. Within the project, OHB matured the workflow for the design and verification of the quality of AM space applications. Three different parts of different complexity levels were developed. One of the highlights is a Reaction Wheel Bracket made of titanium. Manufactured using Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF), this advanced manufacturing technique results in a 20% mass reduction compared to the original precision-machined design. The design is used as a baseline to develop an integral component for CO2M satellites which is part of the upcoming Copernicus Sentinel Expansion mission. Another interesting use case is the Integrated Twin-Mirror from within the spectrometer of the Fluorescence Explorer mission (FLEX) instrument. Leveraging advanced manufacturing techniques, the developed AM design achieves a remarkable 45% mass reduction while substantially improving the natural frequency and minimizing stress concentrations for all relevant load cases. A significant reduction in Surface Form Error (SFE) was achieved which is a relevant factor for the instrument’s performance that could only be obtained through the applied innovative manufacturing technology.

In-depth Veteran Cluster mission comes to an end Cluster II Launched in 2000, Cluster is a unique constellation of four identical spacecraft investigating the interaction between the Sun and Earth’s magnetosphere – our shield against the charged gas, energetic particles and magnetic field coming from our star.Despite a planned lifetime of two years, the Cluster mission has now spent almost 24 years in orbit.Over the past two and a half decades, Cluster’s observations have led to the publication of more than 3200 scientific papers and counting. They have provided scientists with essential insights into the Sun’s impact on the Earth environment and the processes taking place within Earth’s magnetosphere, and improved our understanding of potentially hazardous space weather. Firefoxes and whale spouts light up Earth''s shield Access the video The Sun-Earth connection remains an important topic of study, particularly during the current period of high solar activity.The Cluster satellites will continue to make observations up until September 2024. During their last few months of scientific activity, they will pass through the region in which charged particles are accelerated before producing Earth''s auroras. Researchers will capitalise on the rare chance to study this region using instruments on multiple satellites at the same time.The decades of data stored in the Cluster science archive will continue to enable new science long after the end of the mission. With this treasure trove of data, researchers can revisit and reanalyse past events, conduct new statistical analyses and implement new machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. Salsa’s final steps Cluster operations team oversees Salsa''s last dance Of the four Cluster satellites (named Rumba, Salsa, Samba and Tango), Salsa will be the first to take the plunge back into Earth’s atmosphere.Operators at ESA’s ESOC mission control centre carried out four manoeuvres this January to lower Salsa’s orbit and prepare the satellite for a safe atmospheric reentry in September over a sparsely populated region of the South Pacific Ocean. “The Cluster satellites have highly eccentric orbits that are strongly impacted by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon,” says Bruno Sousa, Head of Inner Solar System Mission Operations at ESOC. “Sometimes, they drop steeply, by more than 30 km in a single orbit. Other times, they don’t drop at all.”“This month, we tweaked Salsa’s orbit to make sure it experiences its final steep drop from an altitude of roughly 110 km to 80 km in September. This gives us the greatest possible control over where the spacecraft will be captured by the atmosphere and begin to burn up.” The timing of the manoeuvres was important. Salsa’s ‘eclipse season’ begins in February. The satellite will spend most of the next few months switched off while located in Earth’s shadow and unable to rely on its solar arrays to generate power.“Salsa’s solar arrays have also been degrading fast since it crossed the Van Allen radiation belts. Maximum available power is decreasing fast and could soon reach a point at which we would be unable to perform the deorbiting manoeuvres,” says Beatriz Abascal Palacios, Cluster Operations Engineer. Unique chance to improve space sustainability Final images of Aeolus during its brief phase as space debris The remaining three spacecraft in the Cluster quartet will continue to carry out scientific observations, with a particular focus on auroral physics, until September. Salsa may join in for some final observations too, if it is still able to generate enough power after the eclipse season.Like many of our satellites, the Cluster spacecraft were designed and launched before ESA’s current guidelines for limiting the creation of space debris came into effect.Nevertheless, ESA is taking action to minimise the environmental impact of its older missions. Last summer, we guided ESA’s wind mission, Aeolus, back to Earth over sparsely populated regions in a first-of-its-kind assisted reentry. Thanks to this month’s activities, Salsa’s reentry in September will take place over a region of similarly sparse population, air, and maritime traffic. Following Salsa’s reentry, the remaining Cluster satellites will enter ‘caretaker’ mode – controlled, but carrying out no new science – until they, too, reenter Earth’s atmosphere in a similar fashion. Rumba will reenter in 2025; Tango and Samba will reenter in 2026. GOCE reenters atmosphere “This is the first time that anyone has targeted the reentry of a satellite with an eccentric orbit like Salsa in this way,” says Stijn Lemmens from ESA’s Space Debris Office. “And the end of the Cluster mission gives us the unique chance to reenter four identical spacecraft at different times."“The experience we gain from safely reentering the same satellite at four different angles and speeds, and under four different sets of atmospheric conditions, will greatly improve our understanding of reentries and help us define the standard for the safe disposal of satellites in similar orbits.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

Marine litter is one of the most pressing environmental problems, with detrimental effects to ecosystems and concerns for human health. The Discovery Element of the ESA’s Basic Activities funded 25 innovative projects to detect and track seaborne plastic litter using satellites. Over the last 70 years, plastic production has grown exponentially. Every year, around ten million tonnes of plastic are thrown in the ocean, the equivalent to a fresh truckload of plastic dumped every minute. Plastic litter is most noticeable along coastlines, but it is also found in the open ocean and even frozen in polar ices, as it travels across large distances. Monitoring marine litter is essential for managing this crisis, and remote sensing from space can help to better inspect the surface of our Planet. ESA is paving the way for better remote sensing ESA funded 25 innovative projects to improve detection of plastic marine litter from space, through the Discovery Campaign ''Remote Sensing of Plastic Marine Litter'', launched on the ESA’s Open Space Innovation Platform (OSIP). Working together to find new solutions Last month ESA and NASA co-organised the workshop “Remote Sensing of Marine Litter 2023” with the theme “Today’s Possibilities, Tomorrow’s Innovation: State of the art, challenges and future directions”. On 16-17 October, around sixty researchers from eleven countries have gathered at ESA ESTEC in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.“During two intensive days, participants exchanged and discussed research results, covering different remote sensing technologies applied across different aquatic environments, from seas and oceans to some of the most polluted rivers in the world,” explains Paolo Corradi, ESA systems engineer and one of the main organisers of the event together with Leopold Summerer, Head of the Advanced Concepts and Studies Office at ESA and Laura Lorenzoni, Program Scientist in the NASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program. “The workshop revealed the great motivation of the participants to continue working on this exciting topic and pinpointed some of the more promising areas of application of remote sensing to best inform decision-making and solutions to the problem of litter pollution,” adds Paolo.Presentations and posters of the workshop are published here Perspectives on remote sensing The workshop brought together several participants from the ESA’s Discovery Campaign on Remote Sensing of Plastic Marine Litter, and was a good opportunity for presenting the results of some the most successful projects. Here is what some of the project managers have to say about how remote sensing can help keeping oceans clean.Talking about detecting litter, Victor Martinez Vicente, bio-optical oceanographer at Plymouth Marine Laboratory, UK and FRONTAL project manager, says: “We are exploiting current observations to better understand where floating marine litter could be accumulating in the ocean, that is, the areas at risk. Because the ocean is very big, mapping areas at risk of accumulation is important to help us focus on smaller areas that then can be targeted with specific sensors to provide a global picture of floating litter”.“Traditional techniques, like networks of in situ observations, cannot really cover the entire area of the ocean at the spatial and temporal scales needed; thus we still miss the big picture of what is happening in terms of plastic pollution on a larger scale. So, for us, it is very relevant to have new tools that can cover these observational gaps,” adds Manuel Arias, Earth Observation scientist at the Institut de Ciències del Mar - CSIC, Spain and Project Manager of the project WASP with Argans Ltd. Plastic litter in global oceans “Using remote sensing technologies, especially different satellites, we have been exploring how best to monitor marine litter accumulations, which are generally a mixture of natural and human made materials with a large portion being plastic,” explains Shungu Garaba, research scientist at the University of Oldenburg, Germany and principal investigator for OP3.“For the future, we first need detection of the accumulations of litter in and along the world’s rivers and coasts on their way to the ocean. Then, we need specific sensors to observe these accumulations with higher spatial and spectral resolution to discriminate marine litter, in particular plastics, from other signals, preferably in combination with a sensor that can provide information about the distribution of litter in the water column,” adds Marieke Eleveld, researcher at Deltares, the Netherlands and Plastic Monitor project lead.Valentina Raimondi, researcher at the Institute of Applied Physics of the National Research Council of Italy and BLUE project lead highlights the need for better measurements: ”The expected amount of plastic supposed to enter the ocean is definitely higher than what we can estimate with observations on the surface of the ocean. A significant fraction might float in the first few metres under the water surface”. Integrating different remote sensing technologies, including LIDAR that uses a LASER beam to penetrate into the water, with new data processing approaches such as artificial intelligence will help detect submerged plastic and classify plastic among other types of marine debris.

To achieve this, we are looking for creative solutions to contribute to greater sustainability in space activities. Reducing debris creation In the past few years, the number of satellites launched has significantly increased and millions of space debris objects are left orbiting Earth, posing risks to operational spacecraft. For that reason, ESA is actively seeking to limit the production of debris in Earth orbit by 2030.But this is just the first step towards space debris neutrality. Following that, the goal is to implement a circular economy in space, ensuring long-term orbital sustainability through in-orbit servicing, in-orbit assembly, in-orbit manufacturing, and eventually in-orbit recycling."Through the Clean Space Initiative, ESA aims to reduce the environmental impact of its activities. Space circular economy is essentially one of the ways we could achieve that in the long-term," explains Antonio Caiazzo, space systems engineer at ESA and campaign manager. Circular economy In-Orbit Servicing (IOS) is not a novel idea at ESA. Recent studies, such as the OMAR (On-Orbit Manufacture, Assembly and Recycling) project, addressed IOS in a smaller scale and helped ESA identify the benefits and the challenges of a circular economy in space. "Now we want to tackle those challenges and push them forwards to make this revolutionary space ecosystem a reality" says Antonio.This is why ESA is looking for ideas for missions and system concepts that could provide on-orbit refurbishment, manufacturing, and recycling. "This call for proposals intends to select preliminary mission or concept systems to do this type of operation in space," says Calum Turner, ESA Young Graduate Trainee also leading this call. "We really encourage innovative ideas coming from academia and industry." Further from Earth – further from being ready. Launch your ideas The proposed mission or system can investigate brand new concepts or improve existing ones that haven''t been completely developed due to certain constraints. "Proposals should clearly identify the needs for space circular economy, including which type of technology is required, its readiness level and feasibility." highlights Calum.The call for ideas will be open until 16 February 2024. Up to five selected teams will be given six months and €100 000 from ESA to develop an overall mission architecture design.The ideas will go through ESA''s SysNova technology assessment scheme, that uses technology challenges to competitively determine the best concepts among a variety of alternative options. The most promising challenge will then be awarded a session at the Agency''s Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) with ESA experts. If successful, a feasibility study might be put forward and the outcome will be presented at ESA''s Ministerial Council in 2025.This call is being run by the Preparation element of ESA''s Basic Activities and Clean Space Office via the Open Space Innovation Platform (OSIP).

Proba-3 scientists view Occulter spacecraft Ahead of the Proba-3 pair launching together later this year, the scientists who will make use of Proba-3 observations were able to see the satellites with their own eyes. Members of this team will test hardware developed for the mission during an actual terrestrial solar eclipse over Northern America next April.The two satellites are currently undergoing final integration in the premises of Redwire near Antwerp in Belgium. They were paid a visit by the Proba-3 Science Working Team, a 45-strong group of solar physicists coming from all across Europe and the wider world. Proba-3 satellites Many of these experts are regular visitors to terrestrial solar eclipse around the globe but are looking forward to the new perspective Proba-3 will open up on the faint solar corona. This mysterious region is important as the place where coronal mass ejections are created – vast eruptions of charged particles that trigger solar storms – as well as influencing the velocity of the solar wind, which is central to determining space weather.“The satellite hardware was quite something in close up,” explains Joe Zender, ESA’s Proba-3 project scientist. “I was particularly struck by how close the camera head on the Coronagraph spacecraft is to the solar array, less than a metre away. While the array relies on high solar illumination, the camera has to remain in complete darkness, with no stray light whatsoever. It really brings it home how precisely that small shadow cast by the Occulter will need to be maintained in place. We also got a peek at the carefully-machined edge of the Occulter spacecraft’s disc – normally kept under protective cover before launch. The curve of this edge has been specially designed to minimise any spillover of diffracted sunlight that would otherwise impact imaging performance.” Russell Howard with Proba-3 Also present was noted US astrophysicist Russell Howard of the John Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab, who played a leading role in NASA’s Parker Solar Probe and the ESA-NASA SOHO mission: “The spacecraft are smaller than the ones that I have been involved with – primarily because this is a single solar viewing imager with two much smaller instruments. But the mission concept is so unique: placing an occulter 150 meters from the telescope to allow imaging extremely close to the limb of the Sun has never been done before, as though the Occulter spacecraft is a mini-Moon. We won’t see quite as close to the solar limb as during a terrestrial eclipse, but having such images for hours on end compared to the 5-10 minutes duration of an eclipse event will be spectacular.” Proba-3 satellites form artificial eclipse Progressing on to the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Brussels, the team went on to discuss preparations for the mission in Brussels, including plans to process and distribute its data, plan co-observations with other space missions and assess Proba-3’s relative performance compared to existing ‘coronagraph’ instruments employed for coronal observations.These are telescopes that incorporate internal occulting discs to obscure the solar disc. The problem is that these internal occulters still experience light spilling around their edges, known as diffraction, blotting out the extremely faint signals of interest. Covered edge of Occulter disc Damien Galano, ESA’s Proba-3 project manager notes: “The best way to reduce diffraction is to increase the distance between the occulter and the coronagraph, which is precisely what Proba-3 is going to do. We are flying our Coronagraph and Occulter on separate platforms for the first time, flying 150 m apart for up to six hours per orbit, applying an array of positioning technologies to keep them rigidly in place.”By definition, full-scale end-to-end testing of Proba-3 is impossible here on Earth. But the meeting heard how the same set of filter wheels developed for Proba-3’s ASPIICS (Association of Spacecraft for Polarimetric and Imaging Investigation of the Corona of the Sun) will be used to observe the solar eclipse over Northern America on 8 April 2024, along with a parallel liquid crystal imaging technology. Proba-3 Science Working Group “The filter wheels allow observation of the corona in different polarisation angles, like switching between different polarised sunglasses,” adds Joe. “The nice about observing during an actual eclipse is we won’t need any occulter, to gain insight of exactly the kind of results we are going to get back from Proba-3.”The Science Working Team also discussed Proba-3’s second instrument, the Digital Absolute Radiometer, DARA, which will measure the total solar irradiance – exactly how much the energy the Sun is putting out at any one time. “Assuming the Sun’s output’s influences Earth’s climate, it’s important to measure any variations as precisely as we can,” notes Joe.Proba-3 is due for launch in September this year, by PSLV launcher from India.

In-depth Hyguane: green hydrogen for Ariane 6, Europe''s Spaceport and more Ariane 6 uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen as fuel for its main and upper stages. Hydrogen in its gaseous form (H2) is rarely found on Earth, and so is currently produced in French Guiana from steam reforming of methanol (CH3OH).Other processes are far more sustainable and so ESA and France’s space agency CNES wish to switch to solar-powered electrolysis of water which can reduce by five the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for hydrogen production. ESA and CNES are determined to reduce the footprint of rocket launches and ground operations at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, and are aiming to deliver low-carbon hydrogen generated by solar-powered electrolysis of water by 2026. Project Hyguane – a portmanteau of the French words for hydrogen, French Guiana and the local Iguanas – is a €40.5M investment in a solar farm and distribution systems and is being designed to be allowed to easily expand in the future. Hyguane signing ceremony at the Jupiter Control Room in French Guiana The Hyguane facility could save over 3000 tonnes of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions a year when operational, while supplying up to 12% of Ariane 6 needs based on nine launches per year. Hyguane: low-carbon hydrogen for Ariane 6 and Europe''s Spaceport The project does not stop at the space sector, by supplying hydrogen fuel cells it will allow low-carbon vehicles and hydrogen electricity generators to operate in French Guiana. The project will ease the transition to hydrogen vehicles and demonstrate that fuel cells can replace diesel-engine generators. A hydrogen refuelling station designed and operated by SARA and a Hydrogen Competence Centre operated by MT-Aerospace are key factors in developing low-carbon transport in French Guiana as they allow for vehicle fuelling and maintenance. The project is a large contribution to CNES and ESA’s sustainability efforts to make 90% of Europe’s Spaceport run on renewable energy by 2030. Teddy Peponnet, head of the project for ESA, said “this novel facility will be a shining example of carbon-free production of hydrogen when it opens and we aim to set an example for a more sustainable future.” The signed tiles demonstrate that the ''paper'' phase of the project has now entered the building phase. The tiles will be stuck to the wall of the Hydrogen Competence Center to mark the Hyguane ''launch'' ceremony on 13 December at the Guiana Space Centre After three years of studies, the project started on 13 December with the signing of the consortium agreement between the parties involved: four companies – Air Liquide, SARA, MT-Aerospace and BEBLUE; three universities – Université de Guyane, Université de Liège, Université Libre de Bruxelles and two institutions – ESA and CNES. ADEME, the french agency in charge of ecology transition is as well part of the project, is financially supporting Hyguane with €10M.Planned for completion in 2026, the project could be extended to double the production of hydrogen and supply additional hydrogen vehicles (such as coaches, buses, and trucks) and hydrogen electricity generators.

Extremely rigid or flexible and springy. Corrosion-resistant and ideal for complex shapes. All of these benefits come from carbon fibre, and when performance matters it is probably part of the package. Tennis rackets, bicycles, racing cars and airliners are just a few products that rely extensively on this miracle material. It’s no surprise that modern rockets also perform better thanks to carbon fibre. More formally known as CFRP – carbon fibre reinforced plastic – this mix of super-strong carbon fibres and the binding resin that holds them in place is a great way to reduce the mass of a rocket, and so increase the payload mass it can carry. Ariane 6 and Vega-C both carry CFRP payload fairings, and the body of the P120C solid-fuel rocket motor that serves as Ariane 6’s boosters and the first stage of Vega-C is one of the world’s largest single-piece CFRP structures.But can CFRP go further, and replace the metallic structures in a rocket’s cryogenic fuel tanks? That is the objective of ESA’s Phoebus programme, which aims to produce upper stage tanks and structures in carbon fibre – and so far it is acing its tests. Testing subscale oxidiser tank made from carbon-fibre reinforced plastic in 2021 The mass reduction of an upper stage design based on Phoebus technology could in theory be enough to add around 1500 kg to the payload performance of a rocket like Ariane 6. That reduction comes from the inherent lightness of CFRP itself and of its great design flexibility, which enables the production of structures with novel shapes and fewer parts than metal counterparts. Production costs could also be lower.After establishing that leak-proof CFRP tanks are in principle possible to manufacture, ESA through its Future Launcher’s Preparatory Programme contracted ArianeGroup and MT Aerospace in 2022 to go from early design studies to production and testing of cryogenic upper-stage tanks and structures. Testing to destruction without explosion Phoebus Phoebus has undergone a number of tests of progressive difficulty over the last weeks. The objective is to expose a mid-scale oxygen tank to thermal and mechanical loads that represent an actual launch. The first tests took place at MT Aerospace in Germany, which worked with ArianeGroup to design and manufacture the tank.First up was a helium test in October: traditional metallic tanks are leak-tested with helium at room –temperature. If the CFRP tank could ace this test then that would both show that the basic concept for a ‘linerless’ leak-tight CFRP tank was possible but also release it for more intensive testing.Next up was a cryogenic pressure test, also in October: the tank held it together while pumped full of liquid nitrogen at –196°C and under pressures of 13 bar (13 times the average atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level), exceeding the stresses it will need to endure as a real rocket tank. Phoebus team According to Kate Underhill, upper stage and propulsion demonstrators project manager in ESA’s Future Launchers Preparatory Programme, understanding the thermal behaviour of the CFRP tank during these cool tests is also important. Liquid hydrogen must be kept at –253° C or it boils to a gas, while oxygen is kept at –183° C in the tanks. CFRP is less thermally conductive than aluminium, so it takes longer for the tank to cool down and the temperature map of the tank is different – the parts that are not in contact with the liquid propellant are warmer than for a metallic tank.As a bonus the Phoebus teams installed and tested a new way of measuring how much propellant a rocket tank contains as it burns away during flight. Using electrical capacitance tomography – exploiting the fact that liquids and gases conduct electricity differently – the tests have shown to be more accurate than current fill-level sensors and they could be incorporated into future rockets to reduce the amount of extra fuel that needs to be taken on board to cover for the inaccuracies of measurements. Reaction oxygen Phoebus full frame Then came the delicate part: a liquid oxygen test. Since this test can be dangerous if things go wrong, in December Phoebus was moved to the Rheinmetall military test site in Unterlüß, Germany – it is best equipped to handle a potential severe fire!One of the biggest challenges with CFRP for fuel tanks is that carbon composite materials can be chemically very reactive with oxygen. As such, careful selection of the resins and fibre materials is required, whilst at the same time always keeping an eye on the potential leak-tightness of the selected resins and fibres. “Phoebus is on a roll, the oxygen tank tests were a complete success, and the tank held it together perfectly – no fire, no explosion, I am a happy project manager.” says Kate, “Unfortunately the trials and tribulations for our little tank that can are not over yet. It has been shipped back to MT Aerospace where it will be pushed and pulled whilst also being pressurised, simulating the complex conditions of a launcher flight. And then after that the poor thing will be cut-up in the laboratory for detailed inspection.” P5 testing facility at DLR Lampoldshausen The next step for the oxygen tank concept is the manufacture of a full-scale version nearly four metres in diameter to match Ariane 6 dimensions. Subsequent testing with a CFRP hydrogen tank will take place at the German aerospace agency’s (DLR) propulsion testing site in Lampoldshausen. Before that, watch this space in 2024 as a hopefully equally plucky scaled-down version of the CFRP hydrogen tank will undergo a similar test campaign to confirm the full-scale design.Kate adds that the ultimate goal is to use such tanks and structures in a new upper stage for Ariane 6 – lighter and cheaper than the existing stage with metallic tanks.

The researchers are investigating whether the high gravity levels experienced during rocket launches might contribute to the anemia afflicting many astronauts in space. ESA''s Large Diameter Centrifuge Based at ESA’s ESTEC technical centre in the Netherlands, the LDC is an 8 m-diameter four-arm centrifuge that gives researchers access to a range of hypergravity up to 20 times Earth gravity for weeks or months at a time.Access to the LDC was arranged through HyperGES, part of the Access to Space for All initiative sponsored by ESA and the United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs, UNOOSA. Preparing samples for testing At its fastest, the centrifuge rotates at up to 67 revs per minute, with its six gondolas placed at different points along its arms weighing in at 130 kg, and each capable of accommodating 80 kg of payload.The five-strong all-female team from Universidad Católica Boliviana ‘San Pablo’ in La Paz, Bolivia, have spent two weeks studying the effects of hypergravity on red blood cells.Astronauts are known to experience numerous adverse health effects while in space. Among them – observed since the earliest days of orbital flight – is anemia, which can cause dizziness and weakness. Red blood cells Recent research shows this anemia is linked to ‘hemolysis’ – in plain words that red blood cells are destroyed at a much higher rate than the usual recycling of old and damaged cells. This finding became the starting point for the team’s research.Team leader Dr. Georgina Chávez explains: “As part of a biology class I assigned a very simple task which many people might do in school: testing how osmosis affects red blood cells. By putting low-salinity ‘hypotonic’ solution in the fluid surrounding the red blood cells, then water moves into the cells and they eventually burst. We saw the paper in Nature on the hemolytic anemia suffered by astronauts, and the parallels with our testing raised our interest. It is possible that hypergravity exposure causes cellular membranes to become fragile, leading to hemolysis. Samples placed in LDC “What is well known is that the distribution of body fluid changes in weightlessness, so this might promote the same kind of destruction of red blood cells. But most of the existing studies have been done in microgravity. We thought, well actually astronauts go through two big bodily changes during spaceflight: to make it into microgravity they first experience a brief but intense period of hypergravity. So we decided to investigate the effects that this initial phase might have in terms of leading to hemolysis in space later.”For hypergravity testing the team prepared various levels of hypotonic solutions to perform ‘osmotic fragility testing’ on samples that were exposed to 7.5 and 15 Earth gravities as well as normal gravity as a control. The hypergravity spins continue for differing test periods of 10 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 minutes, with samples stored at temperatures of 25°C and body temperature. Getting to know the lab “It typically takes a few minutes of high-gravity rocket flight to make it into orbit,” notes team member Daira Quenta. “We want to see how the amount of time spent in hypergravity might make a difference.”The team had been inspired by previous Bolivian participation in other UNOOSA programmes, notably the DropTES (Drop Tower Experiment Series) which enables international researchers to utilise the ZARM drop tower in Bremen, Germany, with a 146-m shaft for brief microgravity testing. Bolivian research team with Large Diameter Centrifuge Team member Marcia Carrasco comments: “We made the connection – if they can do it, we can do it. The opportunity got us motivated.”“We’re training to become biochemistry and bioprocess engineers, which is really quite vocational,” explains team member Belen Flores. “This career encompasses a wide range of options, we might for instance end up working for the pharmaceuticals sector or food companies. We don’t typically have the chance to undertake scientific investigations like this, so this has been exciting.” Hypergravity centrifuge in motion Dr. Chavez adds: “We are an all-female team, which wasn’t intentional, but they are all brilliant students, and it’s fair to say females are a bit more organised!”Team member Natalia Agramont says: “We didn’t think too much about gender at the time, but we have been part of some important initiatives subsequently, including Matilda, an organisation encouraging female Latin America students to go into STEM subjects. And we’ve been featured on Pica, which is a popular TV show for Bolivian teenagers, raising a lot of interest.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

NASA''s Deep Space Optical Communication (DSOC) demonstration will test the use of lasers to transmit and receive more data with distant spacecraft than is possible with the radio waves currently in use.Using a narrow laser beam to communicate with a spacecraft located 300 million km away presents a challenge on both interplanetary and quantum scales. However, if successful, the DSOC demonstration could unlock a world of new possibilities for future deep space missions.ESA will participate in the DSOC demonstration in 2025 and work has begun to develop the required cutting-edge laser technology and ground infrastructure in Europe. In-depth ESA joins deep space communication demonstration “Fibre optic technology on Earth has enabled incredible data transfer speeds for applications like the internet,” says Clemens Heese, the Head of the Optical Technologies section at ESA’s European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. “However, data transfer with spacecraft at interplanetary distances is still limited to the use of radio waves.”“We have already shown that optical communication can offer much higher data rates for Earth observation and telecommunications satellites in low-Earth orbits. But to use it at deep space distances, we need high-power, high-accuracy lasers and super-sensitive single-photon detectors that simply do not yet exist with the required performance.” The communication equipment on NASA''s Psyche spacecraft By using pulses of light with a higher frequency than radio waves, optical communication enables the transfer of more data in a given time period. This higher data rate could allow future deep space missions at certain distances from Earth to carry more sophisticated scientific instruments and return significantly more data than is currently possible.However, testing new technology on a deep space mission, where every kilogram of payload has to be very carefully selected, is a rare opportunity. NASA’s DSOC is the first chance to build more trust in deep space optical communication and enhance its readiness for use in space flight.ESA is participating in the DSOC demonstration to enhance European expertise both within and outside of the Agency. This involvement will enable future European solar system missions to consider using deep space optical communication and will boost European industrial capacity in the vital future technology sector of single-photon quantum optical communication. Psyche – from Greek mythology to Greek mountain tops ESA''s Malargüe tracking station ESA and NASA have a long-standing partnership in deep space communication and interoperability. This collaboration allows ESA spacecraft to communicate with NASA ground stations and NASA missions to communicate with ESA’s Estrack stations, much like how European mobile phones are compatible with cellular networks in the USA, and vice versa. This cross-compatible system ensures seamless communication across vast interplanetary distances and symbolises strong international cooperation in space exploration.By collaborating on the DSOC demonstration, the agencies are factoring this interoperability into the very early stages of the development of a new type of satellite communication.Both agencies are developing their own ground infrastructure to communicate with DSOC. This ground infrastructure must be built at high altitude, in order to avoid as much interference from Earth’s atmosphere and cloud cover as possible. For instance, NASA''s facility is situated in the mountainous regions of California, capitalising on the clear atmospheric conditions there.To select a suitable site for ESA’s ground infrastructure, the team began by looking at the most suitable optical telescopes in Europe that might be used to receive laser pulses from DSOC. The 2.3 m Aristarchos telescope, located at an altitude of 2340 m at the Helmos Observatory in Greece, checked all the necessary boxes. The Helmos and Kryoneri observatories in Greece However, the team still had to find a suitable location for the high-power laser transmitter that will be used to send signals to the spacecraft. The high-power transmitter has to be located nearby, so that signals can be sent to and received from DSOC during the same communication window.Fortunately, 37 km away from the Helmos observatory, across the valley and atop the next mountain peak, is the Kryoneri Observatory. Work is now underway to prepare a single-photon-sensitive detector/receiver at the Helmos observatory and a high-power laser transmitter at the Kryoneri observatory.Both observatories are owned and operated by the Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing (IAASARS) of the National Observatory of Athens, a key partner in this DSOC demonstration, the longest optical link ever to be performed in Europe. A receiver to catch individual photons The Aristarchos Telescope at Helmos Observatory ESA’s deep space optical communication Ground Laser Receiver will take the form of a sophisticated receiver unit known as an ‘optical bench’. This receiver unit will be securely mounted to the rear of the Aristarchos telescope.“The receiver''s detector must be highly sensitive to detect individual quantum particles of light – photons – from DSOC, sent across hundreds of millions of kilometres,” says Sinda Mejri, the lead optical engineer of the ESA’s Ground Laser Receiver system."“To detect the individual photons, the detector needs to be superconducting, meaning it can conduct electricity without any resistance. To achieve this, the receiver’s detector will be cooled to -272.15 degrees Celsius (1 Kelvin). Absorbing a photon disrupts the detector’s superconducting state, creating a measurable electrical pulse.”“While one pixel, only a few microns in size, can achieve this sensitivity, our new detector requires 36 such pixels to work in unison, posing substantial challenges related to quantum mechanics and the required complex electronic circuitry.”Additionally, the detector faces the unique challenge of being cryogenically cooled, while still being able to move as the telescope turns and follows the spacecraft across the sky. Cryogenic systems typically resist movement, and ensuring consistent cooling during motion is another considerable technological challenge.The Ground Laser Receiver also includes electronics to monitor the signal strength from DSOC. If the signal weakens, the system will automatically adjust the telescope''s position to maintain signal strength and relay this information to the laser transmitter 37 km away, ensuring accurate alignment. This setup requires the development of specialised control software to coordinate these operations effectively.The development of ESA’s ground receiver started earlier this year. Once complete, it will be sent to NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California for compatibility testing with an engineering test model of the DSOC transmitter. A laser pushing the limits of modern fibre optics The laser communication terminal on Alphasat The development of the high-power laser transmitter at Kryoneri also poses a technological challenge.“The laser has to be so powerful that it would actually break down the protective coating of its own optical components and mirrors and melt conventional fibre optics if not designed with the necessary precautions,” says ESA Ground Laser Transmitter optical lead engineer Andrea Di Mira. “And we are combining up to seven separate beams that have to work together seamlessly.”With the seven beams combined, the ESA laser will be capable of transmitting photons encoded with information bright enough for DSOC to detect when it is roughly 1.5-2.5 astronomical units (220-370 million km) from Earth. These distances would be typical of a future Mars mission, for example. NASA believes it may be able to push the technology to even further distances. In addition to the high brightness, the laser beam must be pointed precisely in the direction of the distant spacecraft. The required precision is like shining a laser pointer from Earth into a small crater on the Moon.Work has begun to prepare the site for the transmitter at Kryoneri. Once complete, the system will be tested at reduced power using the optical communication terminal of Alphasat, a European technology demonstration satellite now in geostationary orbit. Europe up to the challenge Quantum key distribution from space ESA’s participation in the DSOC demonstration is made possible by a consortium of European companies including qtlabs, Single Quantum, General Atomics Synopta, qssys, Safran Data Systems and NKT Photonics Ltd, and by the National Observatory of Athens, who is providing access to the Helmos and Kryoneri observatories.The project is funded through ESA’s General Support Technology Programme and Technology Development Element.“We are really challenging European industry with this project,” says Sinda Mejri. “But they have eagerly taken up the challenge. The work they carry out here could also give them an edge in the development of important technologies for applications such as Quantum key distribution, used for secure communications, and quantum imaging.”Deep-space optical communication is considered the most challenging form of optical communication. Its technology innovations, especially related to quantum optical communication, will directly benefit ESA’s missions in this field, such as SAGA, Eagle-1, OPS-SAT VOLT or QKDSAT.ESA’s experiments with DSOC will take place in 2025, once the spacecraft is far enough from Earth to be representative of future deep space science and exploration missions.If successful, the demonstration could pave the way for a new generation of Solar System exploration and the development of deep space optical communication stations on Earth. Journey to an ancient metal world Asteroid 16 Psyche - artist''s impression DSOC is riding along with NASA''s Psyche mission but will not transmit Psyche mission data. The Psyche mission’s primary goal is the exploration of the mysterious metal-rich asteroid of the same name.Scientists believe that rocky, terrestrial planets such as Earth contain metallic cores, but their location so far beneath the surface makes them tough to study. The Psyche asteroid offers a rare chance to explore the history and formation of Earth-like planets.Psyche was first discovered by Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis in 1852, as the 16th ever discovered asteroid. Almost two centuries later, Italy is now home to ESA’s Planetary Defence Office who are particularly excited to see the results of the Psyche mission. Humankind’s understanding of asteroids is rapidly increasing: we are getting better at detecting small asteroids before impact with Earth, detecting ones that pass close by, getting up close to study them with spacecraft, and even returning asteroid samples to Earth.The Psyche mission, and the DSOC technology demonstration with it, will enable a greater understanding of the origins of our Universe and enhance our ability to transmit large quantities of scientific data back to Earth.

For the Advanced Telescope for High-Energy Astrophysics (Athena) mission to be successful large, optical filters are needed but until recently high performing filters like those needed were not made in Europe. “Up to now the baseline for these filters comes from outside Europe. The objective of this activity is to try to build a European alternative, raise the TRL and be able to have some of the filters we use in a mission replaced with the ones designed in this activity. If the TRL will be high enough by the time we choose the ones needed for the mission in 2027,” explains Alessandra Ciapponi, the ESA engineer leading the project. Optical filters developed for Athena mission These filters are placed in the instrument to block particles, electrons and photons that fall outside the desired energy range (in this case, X-rays), while providing high X-Ray transmittance and enduring temperatures & differential pressure conditions compliant with the operation on the spacecraft.Development of these filters began a long time ago, with the activity investigating various possible materials for a thin membrane that sits over a metal mesh, together becoming a filter such as polymide and silicon nitride."Polymide was ok as the baseline materia and demonstrated good scalability but some concerns were raised when pushing the technology to manufacture very large size and very thin filters. They will require further improvement. For silicon nitride a clear problem was found in its scalability to a large area size filter. So we began to investigate carbon nano tubes as a material instead," says Ciapponi.Vibration tests made clear that a potential point of breakage for the membrane is related to the attachment and adherence of the metal mesh to the thin CNT membrane. ATHENA mission carbon nanotubes "We have already begun a follow on project under the GSTP De-Risk Framework,” Ciapponi details. “If we exchange the metal mesh with a carbon nanotube material as well as the membrane, it will again improve transmission and the resistance of the filters against vibration.” Work is ongoing and it is also the objective of a second contract .The Athena mission will carry two instruments: the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) and the Wide field Imager (WFI). Full size test carbon nano-tube filters were built to fit some of the various target filter shapes of the ATHENA including the optical blocking filter for the WFI (see image), area up to 160 x 160 mm2.“Carbon nano-tube filters are now being investigated also for the NASA’s MUSE MIDEX mission, this is a very big success for the GSTP program,” concludes Ciapponi.AMETEK led a consortium that includes Oxford Instruments and Canatu, in Finland and the University of Palermo, in Italy.

Headquartered in Scotland and with a site in Denmark, the company’s Prime rocket measures 19 m high and is powered by a cluster of 3D-printed engines that run on liquid oxygen and bio-propane, a clean-burning renewable fuel. Prime is also being designed to be reusable in the future. Ultra-green launch facility Boost! and Orbex The goal of the contract is to help develop an ultra-green launch system including its ground support systems with minimal environmental impact.Orbex Prime will use a bio-propane propellant made from sustainable resources, such as plant and vegetable waste to reduce the rocket’s environmental footprint. As part of the contract Orbex will build a biopropane purification system at the launch complex. Orbex Prime on launch pad On the launch pad, a new helium transfer and recovery system is being developed that will use helium gas to push the biopropane into Prime’s tanks while recovering and reusing the helium if a launch has to be delayed – instead of letting the helium gas to escape into the atmosphere.The launch pad has many installations to safely erect, sustain, and operate the rocket from rollout to launch. All the infrastructure will be efficient while environmentally compliant, minimising waste as well as considering the skyline of the surrounding countryside. The launch pad system will have state-of-the-art environmental compliance while offering efficient operations and rapid turn-around between each launch campaign.To monitor and ensure reliable and safe operations with low environmental impact a climate analysis outpost will provide Orbex with all the data needed to keep to its commitments.

When Mars Express arrived at the Red Planet on Christmas Day 2003, it was travelling at 18 000 km/h. It had to fire its main engine to slow down enough to be captured into orbit and avoid flying off into space. The braking was a success, but it used 264 kg of propellant. Mars Express entered orbit around Mars by braking with rocket propulsion This technique has been used successfully at Mars for 16 missions since 1971, including ESA''s Trace Gas Orbiter in 2016. But for future missions, there could be another way. Mars is surrounded by an atmosphere: what if we flew a spacecraft straight through it, making use of atmospheric drag rather than propellant to slow it down?This idea, known as ''aerocapture'', is not a new one. It has been tempting engineers since the mid-1960s for two main reasons. Firstly, it would reduce the amount of propellant that the spacecraft needs to carry. Secondly, it would mean that we could choose to arrive at a planet with a higher speed, cutting cruise time. Computer-generated image of a spacecraft deploying a parachute-like device to go into orbit around Mars Aerocapture could enable small spacecraft to reach orbit, and in future be useful also for larger spacecraft in human exploration scenarios. While Mars is an attractive first destination for the application of aerocapture beyond Earth, the technique’s advantages are particularly apparent for ambitious scientific missions to worlds with atmospheres beyond Jupiter.But aerocapture has never been attempted, neither at Mars nor at other worlds. The idea has so far been perceived as too risky for its first use in a scientific mission, and sending a spacecraft to Mars with the sole aim of demonstrating aerocapture had been thought too expensive.The Preparation element of ESA''s Basic Activities recently took a step towards turning Mars aerocapture from theory to reality. It funded two teams – one led by ArianeGroup and the other by Vorticity – to design spacecraft that use a feasible, simple aerocapture system. The hope was to become confident enough in aerocapture that we would be happy to consider using it on future science or exploration missions.ESA engineer Andrew Ball oversaw the research: "The two teams took slightly different approaches and philosophies – this is great, because we can now combine the best of both." Mars Express in orbit around Mars The topic was selected following a Preparation call for ideas for future mission concepts. Three separate teams submitted ideas on Mars aerocapture. Following open competition, ESA contracted ArianeGroup and Vorticity to outline designs and explore the main technology developments needed to make them possible.Andrew says: "One of the starting points for my interest in this was thinking, well, aerocapture… nobody''s done it yet but lots of space engineers think that somebody just needs to try it for the first time. We know that Europe can deliver spacecraft to Mars, so why not use our experience to go a step further and achieve Mars aerocapture?"A key challenge with aerocapture comes down to control. When using thrusters to slow down a spacecraft, you are (not literally!) in the driving seat. But aerocapture demands just the right amount of atmospheric drag to put the spacecraft into the desired orbit. The drag depends on the size and shape of the spacecraft, its velocity, its entry angle, and the atmosphere of Mars.It also depends on the device used to generate drag – typically a rigid shield, an inflatable shell or a trailing decelerator. The Preparation studies both employed the simplest version of aerocapture control, which starts with a large, outer drag device. At a particular moment, when the spacecraft calculates it has decelerated by the right amount, the outer part of this drag device is thrown off, leaving the smaller, central aeroshell to take care of the final part of the atmospheric pass. Once the spacecraft is out the other side of the atmosphere, it throws off the protective aeroshell, leaving the spacecraft alone to orbit Mars. Mars aerocapture – Drag modulation Each study explored two mission types: one standalone, and one ''piggybacking'' on another Mars mission. For both types, the ArianeGroup team investigated inflatable drag devices with a rigid central shell. The Vorticity team investigated a different inflatable decelerator for the standalone mission, while for the piggyback mission they aimed for a concept based as far as possible on existing technologies – using only rigid drag devices."These were two of the first ever system studies to look at this specific aerocapture technique, using many existing technologies, and they went deeper than before," says Andrew. "We will digest the concepts further, discuss with experts on specific topics, and then come up with a more focused mission scenario and set of technology development requirements where needed. We hope that this will lead to a full mission concept study, including detailed launch and delivery scenario and a plan for the mission of the small orbiter after its aerocapture." Views of Vorticity’s piggyback (top left) and standalone (top right) mission concepts, and those of ArianeGroup (piggyback bottom left, standalone bottom right). Vorticity teamed up with Eptune Engineering and Fluid Gravity Engineering for their mission concept. ArianeGroup was supported by Airbus (Spain), R.Tech and Jehier. If ESA decides to proceed with such a mission, it could launch from the early 2030s, becoming the first demonstration of Mars aerocapture. It would be ambitious considering that it is not possible to fully test the technique around Earth due to the very different atmospheres and additional challenges of deep space navigation that come with visiting Mars."Even if we don''t go much further with this specific concept, opportunities to make use of the technologies may arise elsewhere," concludes Andrew. "For example, some of them could be useful for deorbiting objects from Earth orbit, perhaps the return of upper stages. This could eventually even see a business case."

A new ESA project extends this versatility still further, by investigating the production of big aluminium mirrors for space-based astronomy. Applying a novel technique, the team joined together multiple aluminium segments to form a single mirror. The resulting surface had to be optically perfect however, with no trace left of joins in the combined metal. Ariel spacecraft Setting the target for the project is the 1.1-m-diameter aluminium main mirror of ESA’s Ariel mission, which will acquire the temperature profile and chemical composition of distant exoplanets as they cross in front of their parent stars.Ariel’s mirror will be produced in a conventional manner, starting with a single large piece of aluminium, but the concept of making a mirror by fixing together multiple aluminium segments represents a valuable backup method, potentially applicable to follow-on astronomy missions. Exoplanet passing in front of parent star “Making such a large mirror out of aluminium has never been done before, but holds various advantages,” explains ESA materials engineer Advenit Makaya. “It means that the mirror will be homogenous with the rest of its parent telescope structure, avoiding thermal discontinuities that risk putting observing instruments out of alignment, and avoids the need for interfaces, reducing mass and complexity.”ESA optical systems engineer Dana Tomuta, overseeing the project, adds: “In addition conventional glass or ceramic telescope mirrors are actually coated in aluminium to maximise their reflectivity, so finishing and polishing an aluminium reflecting surface represents a much simpler task. Spinning molten aluminium into thin strips “The challenge is finding a practical way to produce aluminium mirrors of the size that future missions will need, considering that the finished mirror needs to combine a large collecting area with precise curvature down to an accuracy of a few nanometres – billionths of a metre – in order to precisely reflect the light it harvests from space to the telescope’s secondary mirrors and imaging system.”As a first step, this project targeted a prototype ‘breadboard’ mirror of 30 cm across. ESA’s prime contractor was high precision optics company Media Lario in Italy, working with Dutch company RSP Technology. This latter firm has developed aluminium alloys obtained through a ‘rapid solidification’ process, involving spinning molten aluminium on a rotating wheel to obtain very thin strips that possess an ultra-fine microstructure. Standard vs fine-grain aluminium microstructures Advenit notes: “This very fine grain structure is much better for surface polishing, because the grain of the material determines its overall roughness.” These aluminium strips are then chopped into pieces put together into a can, with heat and iso-static pressure applied to form a larger ‘billet’, then cooled rapidly to preserve the ultra-fine microstructure that has been formed in the thin strips.But the overall size of these rapidly-solidified aluminium billets is limited to about 50 cm across. So the project turned to a method called ‘diffusion bonding’, involving an enlarged version of the same technique to join two or more segments together. Segments joined together using diffusion bonding Advenit says: “To stick them together we add extra aluminium chips to the joint, then apply heat to make them partially liquid. This makes the aluminium of the segments migrate into each other, without melting them entirely.”The first challenge was that repeated heating of the selected aluminium RSA-6061 alloy can produce magnesium and silicon precipitate particles.Follow-up polishing removes these precipitates, but this also leaves holes which reduce optical quality. The back of the mirror was machined “We got around this through very strict process control,” adds Advenit. “This meant sourcing very pure aluminium alloy for a start, because the number and size of particulates will grow through the several heating steps involved.”Production was followed by polishing – and the standard extraction of material from the rear of the mirror, in a honeycomb pattern to reduce mass – then a high-end test for a high-performance mirror: laser-based interferometry, where laser light reflected from the mirror is combined with a second light source reflected from a reference surface. The resulting interference pattern highlights any ‘wavefront error’ from the desired curvature, down to a few nanometres. 30-cm diameter test aluminium mirror “Our first attempt retained a visible line from a join,” says Dana. “No matter how much you polish, that line will remain there, because it comes from the underlying material. So we had a few iterations, improving the technology each time. But our third attempt achieved 11 nanometres, which is already a considerable achievement. As a next step, we want to look into scaling up to a larger size.”This Diffusion Bonded Mirror project was supported through ESA’s Technology Development Element, supporting promising new ideas for space, the basic ideas factory of the Agency. Interferometric measurement of prototype mirror “It’s been a fantastic collaboration between different ESA sections, which came out of an initial discussion between us,” notes Dana. “Because you cannot develop a mirror without understanding the materials and processing involved, and the needs of the final application, so the project – and our industry partners – benefited from a full spectrum of expertise.”Marcos Bavdaz, heading the Technology Preparation Section of ESA’s Directorate of Science, comments: “Media Lario is keeping the sample at their premises to perform polishing tests, to compare the results with the standard alternative. It’s a been good project because it enlarges our future options.” Nadia Missaglia, project manager of the study for Media Lario adds: “it’s been a fantastic study with ESA and RSP Technology; looking at the potential we are very pleased to have contributed to expanding the prospects for future applications. We are grateful to ESA for letting us keep the sample at our premises for follow-up testing.” Like Thank you for liking You have already liked this page, you can only like it once!'),

To ensure the smooth operation of these moving parts, ESA is researching lubricants that are more durable, eco-friendly, and suitable for space missions. Ionic liquids have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional lubricants. Ionic liquids are fluid salts that have relatively low melting temperatures. They are known for being very stable chemicals, and resistant to high temperatures and thermo-oxidation. The unique characteristics of these salts make them invaluable in various applications, especially as lubricants and green solvents.One of the main advantages of ionic liquids is that they offer a safer alternative to traditional solvents that pose environmental and health risks. Unlike other solvents, these liquid salts are non-volatile, which means that they release fewer harmful gases into the atmosphere and generate less contamination. Additionally, in many cases, they are more stable and longer lasting than conventional solvents."There is also another big motivation to look into ionic liquids as lubricants. Many greases for space applications contain fluorinated organic substances. Such substances could have harmful effects on human health and environment. Recently, the European Chemical Agency is considering imposing stricter regulations to curb the use of these substances," says Malgorzata Holynska, ESA engineer. "This could have an impact not only on the space industry, but also in our daily lives e.g. with non-stick frying pans." X-ray test of friction-stir welded tank Despite being promising substitutes to PFA-based lubricants, there is a major concern associated with the use of ionic liquids: their potential to cause corrosion in metallic materials. "At ESA, we have been working with these substances for some time and performing specific testing such as vapour pressure, outgassing properties, basic friction and wear testing. Those tests showed promising results, but we encountered this problem with corrosiveness." explains Malgorzata. "It was therefore very timely when we received an idea on the Open Discovery Ideas Channel of OSIP, looking into this topic." The idea for an Early Technology Development, "Highly Durable Vacuum Lubricant Formulations Based On Ionic Liquids" from MATERIALES passed the idea and proposal stages and is now implemented under ESA''s Discovery Programme.The selected team, the German company MATERIALES, is actively addressing this problem, conducting research to develop formulations that incorporate ionic liquids with protective effects. "Although widely researched in academia, most of the studies with these substances are limited and do not mention their entire suitability for lubricant use," tells Fabian Schüler, managing director of the company."We are working on a laboratory prototype with non-corrosive effects that can be produced on a large scale for commercial use. To achieve this, we want to make sure that the lubricant is durable and meets all major requirements and specifications for space applications." adds Fabian. Evaluating oils for space MATERIALES is collaborating with two subcontractors: the European Space Tribology Laboratory (ESTL) and German Engineering Institut Paul Matzke (IPM). ESTL conducts tests with lubricants under vacuum conditions and their extensive experience in the space industry makes them a valuable consultant for this project. On the other hand, IPM specialises in corrosion mechanisms, allowing MATERIALES to better understand and develop effective mitigation strategies.At the moment, ESA is not planning to use these greases in any specific mission. The focus of this activity is essentially on generic space applications, as the lack of lubrication on metallic surfaces could damage delicate instruments in spacecraft.This research is also a significant step towards European independence in terms of access to more sustainable space lubricants. "The PFAS greases we currently use are supplied by non-European manufacturers. With MATERIALES, we would have a European source of lubricants, that was also responsible for researching and solving the corrosion problem." highlights Malgorzata.The idea was first submitted through the Open Discovery Ideas Channel, run by Discovery & Preparation, which specifically looks for innovative ideas that could be implemented as system studies, early technology developments, or PhD or postdoc research co-funded by ESA and a university.

But current deployers used to release cubesats from their mothercraft are unsuitable for the peculiar environment of deep space. A new activity from GSTP and ISIS Space, in the Netherlands, has developed a new deployer to accomplish exactly this. Hera will demonstrate several new technologies such as visual-based asteroid close-proximity navigation and control, inter-satellite communication and a novel even more precise delta-DOR interplanetary radio-tracking and navigation technique – all of which pave the way for future interplanetary missions. Among the many innovative, technology demonstration aspects of this mission, the use of CubeSats in deep space marks a significant leap forward in space technology. Deep Space Deployer "This presents a significant departure from the typical environment CubeSats encounter in low Earth orbit (LEO)," explained Paolo Martino, the Technical Officer managing the activity. “The journey to deep space introduces unprecedented challenges, primarily due to an extended operational timeline. Unlike their conventional deployment in LEO, these CubeSats will undergo a journey spanning more than two years between launch to the commencement of their operations—a scenario seldom encountered by these miniature satellites.”Martino highlighted the technical obstacles posed by Hera''s prolonged journey. "During the long cruise, the CubeSats will need regular check-ups as their batteries, charged at launch, will gradually lose their charge over the two-year duration. As a result, these satellites may start their operations at half the charge, which is less than ideal." As part of the development of the mission, GSTP has funded the development of a CubeSat deployer suitable for deep space missions. Martino emphasised the critical role of the deployer, serving as a conduit between the Hera spacecraft and the hosted CubeSats. "It’s an umbilical connection, a set of cables linking Hera with the CubeSats, which facilitates regular charging while the CubeSats remain dormant."Furthermore, Martino elaborated on the novel adaptations required for deep space missions. Traditional CubeSat deployers use strong springs that eject CubeSats at high speeds, which would be unsuitable for the extremely low gravity environments around asteroids, instead kicking the CubeSat far away into space."Our development focuses on a low-speed release mechanism, enabling precise deployment at approximately two to three centimetres per second. This facilitates greater control and accuracy, essential for missions in such unique environments."The activity has adopted an intricate two-stage mechanism for deployment. Initially, a traditional spring pulls the CubeSat out of the deployer, leaving it suspended. Subsequently, after necessary check ups of the CubeSats systems, a more delicate mechanism allows controlled release ensuring a slow mission commencement. Deep Space Deployer on Vibrations Testing Platform The culmination of these innovations led to the creation of the Deep Space Deployer, a crucial component integrated into the Hera spacecraft. This deployer ensures the safe deployment of CubeSats at a low velocity close to the asteroid system. Enabling the CubeSat to be released in a controlled way and for it to be powered up and diagnostics to be run before it is sent to complete its mission.If successful, CubeSats will enable entirely new categories of deep space missions, from burgeoning commercial ventures aimed at exploring beyond the moon to missions around small bodies, targeting asteroids for commercialisation, it is a step forward in space exploration.Martino highlighted the successful qualification of the Deep Space Deployer, which has been manufactured and flight models already integrated to the Hera mission.

The test lasted over 30 hours and consisted of a full launch chronology enriched by qualification tests on several launch system functions including ventilation of cavities, launch range interfaces, and environmental characterisation.23 November 2023: Combined test, long-duration firing of the core stage with Vulcain 2.1 engine, Kourou, French GuianaThe combined hot-firing test (CTHF) was conducted with the test model of Ariane 6 on the launch pad at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana. It consisted of a major full-scale rehearsal of a complete launch timeline, followed by more than seven minutes of stabilised operation covering the entire core stage flight phase. The planned operations took around 24 hours with an engine ignition 12 hours after starting operations. The test was a complete success as all functional aspects were tested and functioned as expected, it covered all aspects required for qualification.

It is again a test representative of a launch chronology, meant for anticipating degraded cases to ensure launcher robustness and for preparing launcher exploitation. The test will end with a short core stage engine ignition.First flight periodESA, CNES and ArianeGroup are targeting the first launch of Ariane 6 between mid June and end of July 2024. Ariane 6 is an all-new design, created to succeed Ariane 5 as Europe''s heavy-lift launch system. With Ariane 6''s upper stage restart capability, Europe''s launch capability will be tailored to the needs of multiple payload missions, for example to orbit satellite constellations. This autonomous capability to reach Earth orbit and deep space supports Europe''s navigation, Earth observation, scientific and security programmes. Ongoing development of Europe''s space transportation capabilities is made possible by the sustained dedication of thousands of talented people working in ESA''s 22 Member States.

Accompanied by the first ESA astronaut, Ulf Merbold, the Spacelab module took flight inside the Space Shuttle’s cargo bay, turning NASA’s ‘space truck’ into a mini-space station for scientific research. Europe continues to be highly active in the crewed module business to this day. ESA''s Spacelab module being integrated with the Space Shuttle After Spacelab came ESA’s Columbus laboratory among many other modules of the International Space Station – Node 2, Node 3 and the Earth-watching Cupola – the ATV and Cygnus cargo spacecraft, the European Service Module of the Orion lunar orbiter, modules for the private Axiom space station and now crucial elements of the Gateway station due to orbit the Moon.The industrial legacy of Spacelab is clear. The companies involved have changed names several times since the 1970s, but pressure shells are still being machined from space-grade aluminium-copper alloy 2219 in Turin, Italy – in premises run today by Thales Alenia Space. Aeritalia Spacelab poster In some cases these shells go on to be integrated on the spot in Turin, as in the case of ESA’s Gateway modules. For other product lines, such as the Orion ESMs, integration halls at Bremen in Germany fit them with equipment needed to make them spaceworthy, as was done for Spacelab more than four decades ago. Today these form part of an Airbus Defence and Space facility.Keeping vacuum at bayPressure shells are a fundamental element of module design, serving to keep external vacuum at bay. They are made of metal sheets a few millimetres thick, shaped into cylinders, bounded by conical end pieces. Spacelab measured 6.7 m in length with a diameter of 4.1 m, the latter set by the dimensions of the Shuttle cargo bay in which it sat. Columbus and the other European-made ISS modules have just slightly larger diameters for the same reason.By comparison, ESA’s International Habitat module for the Gateway, I-Hab is about 8 m long but just 3 m in diameter – the same width as the Turin-made pressure shell for the ISS-resupplying Cygnus. ESA’s other Gateway module, the ESPRIT Refuelling Module is 6.4 m in length and 4.6 m in diameter, though a large part of its volume is taken up with fuel tanks, plus a window-fitted pressure tunnel that astronauts can pass through, with the same length and diameter as I-Hab. Cygnus cargo spacecraft “Gateway elements might be smaller than previous European modules but should also be stronger,” explains ESA materials and processes engineer Joao Gandra. “The big difference is that – as with Europe’s latest Axiom and Cygnus pressure shells – they are now welded using ‘friction stir welding’, which softens rather than melts metals, applying friction to join them together. While traditional welding can impart stresses into joints, this technique results in stronger welds with improved performance.”“Today all our modules are made in this way,” adds Walter Cugno, VP of Exploration and Science at Thales Alenia Space, who worked on Spacelab as a product assurance engineer. “Our capability to supply pressurised elements – built up initially through ESA projects, along with bilateral agreements between Italian space agency ASI and NASA to produce ISS modules – is a key asset for all human exploration initiatives, in low-Earth orbit, the Moon and eventually on Mars.”The I-Hab will serve as living quarters aboard the multi-module Gateway for crews of four for up to 30 days at a time. I-Hab on Gateway Mark Wagner, leading ESA’s Lunar Gateway Baseline, Verification and Assembly, Integration and Testing Team, is helping ensure the module is ready for duty, and a launch currently scheduled for 2028.Working with Gateway partnersMark explains: “This is only one module making up a multi-module station, so we need to verify that I-Hab is compatible with all the interfaces agreed with our partner agencies such as NASA, the Canadian Space Agency and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Adding to that, our development schedules are not in parallel: NASA’s HALO module – whose pressure shell is also being sourced from Turin – and the Power and Propulsion Element are due to fly together first. We need to be sure that all intermodule interfaces and functions are compatible with the rest of the international Gateway programme.“As one example, I-Hab’s Environmental Control and Life Support System, being supplied to us by JAXA, needs to work together with its equivalent in HALO. The I-Hab module thermal control system is interconnected by heat exchangers with the other modules and visiting vehicles serving the entire Gateway outpost to dump heat loads via external pumped radiators to deep space. These and other combined systems need to work together flawlessly.” Gateway blueprint Close quartersI-Hab’s relatively small size was set by launch mass constraints. The module designers had to rise to the challenge of fitting all necessary systems into just 10 cubic metres of habitable volume, including scientific equipment, cooking facilities including a pull-out galley table, stores, life support and even a quartet of private booths for sleeping.“Previous ISS modules – like Spacelab before them – were designed with an up and down orientation just because astronauts find that easier to work with. With I-Hab we don’t really have that luxury, because we need to make use of all available space as efficiently as we can, while at the same time fulfilling all human factor and crew-performance-related requirements.” Gateway virtual reality session There will be no toilet however, for the time being; the crew will have to pop back to Orion for that. And early expeditions will have to bring their own consumables with them, one of the reasons that missions will be limited to 30 days at a time, together with high levels of deep space radiation. So for the majority of each year the Gateway will be uncrewed and will need to be overseen accordingly.Astronaut testingTo check that I-Hab is a suitable a place to live and work in, the module development team have turned to veteran ESA astronauts including Samantha Cristoferreti, Alexander Gerst and Luca Parmitano, for early ‘human in the loop’ design assessments. There will be also human testing campaigns based on a representative mock-up of I-Hab installed at Thales Alenia in Turin as well as making use of VR – and in future combining the two in the form of augmented reality applications. Gateway with ESPRIT module right “We really aim to draw on the experience they have from working in orbit aboard ISS,” adds Mark. “They are helping our development team to check on all kinds of variables, like the quality of the lighting, the legibility of labels, the emergency egress layout, even the crew compartments – how suitable they are for privacy and sleep.”I-Hab will aim for the same shirtsleeves working environment engineered for Spacelab and the ISS modules, with a 22°C temperature and 50% humidity, although the atmospheric pressure will be 0.7 atmospheres compared to the sea level pressure that prevails on the Station, helping drive down mass. Gateway''s I-Hab module under construction in Turin Mark adds: “Despite being smaller, I-Hab will be more inclusive in the sense we are designing for 99% astronaut accommodation, meaning almost all the very smallest female astronauts to the biggest male astronauts will be able to operate equipment easily and comfortably – such as opening hatches or rapidly disconnecting fluid lines – compared to an equivalent 95 percentile figure for the ISS.”I-Hab’s development has passed through its Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and is currently in its detailed design phase. For the second ESA-provided Gateway module, ERM – the ESPRIT Refueling Module, the contractual agreement is currently being finalised, while its PDR is due soon.This latest example of European crewed module development has a design lifetime of 15 years although judging by the example of the ISS, it is likely to go on operating for much longer still. Gateway modules taking shape Based on the current architecture of the lunar Gateway outpost, more than half of this inspiring space station will be European in origin.And Europe’s basic Spacelab-inspired module template looks likely to venture still further into space, with a contract recently signed between ASI and Thales Alenia Space to design modules for the lunar surface, to function as part of a future Moon base.

In-depth For this rehearsal, the boosters were not ignited so Ariane 6 stayed firmly on the launch pad at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, as planned. Ariane 6 before core stage full fire test The engine-fire trial reenacts how the Ariane 6 core stage will fire during a normal flight into space. Once complete the main engine would shut down and the core stage would separate from the upper stage, which would then take over propulsion and complete its mission.The trial, conducted with a test model on the launch pad at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, was the longest ‘full-stack'' run yet for Ariane 6’s lower liquid propulsion module with a Vulcain 2.1 engine. “The teams from ArianeGroup, CNES and ESA have now run through every step of the rocket''s flight without it leaving Earth,” says ESA’s Director General Josef Aschbacher.“This milestone rehearsal comes after years of designing, planning, preparing, building and hard work from some of the finest space engineers in Europe. We are back on track towards resecuring Europe’s autonomous access to space. Well done to all involved!” Vulcain 2.1 firing The Vulcain 2.1 engine burnt through almost 150 tonnes of propellant in the Ariane 6 core stage tanks – liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, the latter supercooled to temperatures below -250°C. Vulcain 2.1 is an evolution of the Vulcain 2 engine which made Ariane 5 Europe''s most successful launch system to date. The upgrade has a simplified and cheaper design, and new technology in the engine nozzle and ignition system has been moved from the engine to the launch pad structure, to make the stage perform better and cost less. Road to Ariane 6 It took just over two hours and required teams of people and delicate operations to load the rocket’s central core with fuel. The filling operations were performed during a long countdown that included other qualification tests, similar to the previous rehearsals this year. For fidelity and to guarantee launcher stability, the upper stage tanks were also fueled – even though the upper stage engine only kicks in once in orbit after separation from the main stage and so was not fired during this ground test.The launch pad – operated by France’s space agency CNES – used its water deluge system to temper the heat from the engine.ESA’s Director of Space Transportation, Toni Tolker-Nielsen, added his vote of confidence in the teams across Europe working to bring Ariane 6 to service: "A huge thanks to all of our dedicated colleagues who are committed and working tirelessly to see this rocket fly.” Ariane 6 after combined hot fire test The test followed a shorter burn in September (known as CTLO1) when Ariane 6''s tanks were filled and its Vulcain 2.1 engine briefly ignited and switched off, and the filling and draining test executed in October (known as CTLO2.1) to check the launch system functions such as draining fuel in the presence of multiple simulated failures.A last hot-fire test of the upper stage is being prepared and planned for December 2023 at the German Aerospace Center, DLR, Lampoldshausen test centre.

But the back-up thrusters had never been used before.If something had damaged them during CryoSat’s 13 years in orbit, there was a small chance that the mission would come to an immediate end after the switch. What is CryoSat? Glacier ice loss visualised as a cube CryoSat is ESA’s satellite dedicated to measuring the thickness of polar sea ice and monitoring changes in the ice sheets that blanket Greenland and Antarctica.The mission was designed to last roughly 5 years. It has now spent over 13 years in orbit.“Since 2010, CryoSat has used its Synthetic Radar Altimeter (SAR) to monitor land and sea ice everywhere on Earth to help scientists demonstrate the important role ice plays in regulating climate and being affected by global warming,” says Tommaso Parrinello, CryoSat Mission Manager."CryoSat is a gift that keeps on giving. Its thirteen-year climate record of global ice and sea levels is unparalleled, and long may it continue."Recent mission highlights include the first ever year-round map of Arctic Sea ice and our most accurate estimates yet for the ice volume lost by Earth’s glaciers and polar ice sheets. These data are critical to inform climate reports and policy makers.CryoSat''s data are also shaping the design of new ice-monitoring satellites, such as the Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimeter (CRISTAL) mission. What was the problem with CryoSat? CryoSat scale model inside the control room In order to make ultra-precise measurements of Earth or the cosmos, most satellites conduct regular manoeuvres to keep them in the perfect orbit.CryoSat uses compressed nitrogen to manoeuvre in space. The gas is stored at high pressure in a fuel tank and carried through a series of pipes and valves to thrusters. The thrusters release the gas out into space, pushing or turning the satellite in any commanded direction.Fuel consumption was not expected to be a limiting factor for CryoSat. But in 2016, the operators flying CryoSat at ESA’s European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, noticed that the spacecraft was using up its 37 kilograms of compressed nitrogen much faster than expected.As of November 2023, CryoSat has 13 kg of fuel left – 13 kg less fuel left than it should have based on the use of the thrusters for orbit maintenance manoeuvres and attitude control.When the fuel tank drops below 5 kg, the satellite will no longer be able to reliably control the direction it points or maintain its orbit. What caused the leak? CryoSat’s nitrogen propellant is stored in a fuel tank at high pressure. A pressure regulator converts the high-pressure air into much lower pressure for use by the thrusters.Together with the experts at the satellite’s manufacturer, Airbus, the ESA team has pinpointed the location of the leak to one of CryoSat’s smaller attitude thrusters.At first, the leak rate was small, but it increased over the first few years and has reached a stable rate that would still bring the CryoSat mission to the end in 2025.One explanation for this could be that a small crack appeared somewhere and grew to a certain size before stopping. But it is difficult to diagnose this kind of problem from the ground, and it’s impossible to know for sure. How did you save the satellite? Kiruna station CryoSat has a secondary, back-up propulsion system connected to its fuel tank.On 21 November, at 10:45 CET, operators at ESOC initiated the swap to this back-up system, as CryoSat passed over Svalbard station on Spitzbergen Island and ESA’s Kiruna station in Sweden.First, leaving the primary thrusters connected, they opened the main valve to the back-up propulsion system for the first time in CryoSat’s 13 years in space.At ESOC in Germany, CryoSat’s spacecraft operations engineers and the team from Airbus monitored screens as the pressure rose – both inside the back-up propulsion system on CryoSat and in the control room on Earth.The pressure in the back-up system stabilised – indicating that it was not suffering from any major issues of its own – and the satellite’s onboard computer was instructed to use the back-up thrusters instead of the primary thrusters that it has used since launch.And then… silence. CryoSat team monitors the spacecraft during propulsion system swap CryoSat was left alone as it flew southbound over Africa, connected to and using its back-up thrusters for the first time.“CryoSat’s backup system is robust and was likely to work as intended,” says CryoSat Spacecraft Operations Manager, Jens Lerch. “And if there was a problem with it, during the switch or at any point in the future, the satellite is capable of swapping back to its primary system autonomously.”“But we couldn’t know for sure. The back-up hasn’t been needed during the 13 years that CryoSat has been in space. During this time, it could have suffered a similar leak or been damaged by something like a micrometeoroid – and we had no way to test it previously without exposing us to the same risks we faced today.”Thankfully, 25 minutes later, CryoSat rose above the horizon of the Troll ground station in Antarctica fully functional.With the proper functioning of the back-up attitude control thrusters confirmed, the main valve to the primary thrusters was closed to stop the flow of gas through the leak.The next day, 22 November, the flight control team at ESA conducted an ‘orbital control manoeuvre’ to test the two larger thrusters in the back-up system.As no issues were found during or after the manoeuvre, CryoSat’s back-up thrusters are now officially commissioned, and the satellite is capable of continuing scientific activities to the end of the decade and possibly beyond. Hold on, the leak was detected in 2016. Why wait until now to do something? At any time since launch, CryoSat has had the ability to swap to its back-up propulsion system if its onboard computer detected a sudden major issue with the primary system.But reacting to a slow leak represents a more difficult decision than reacting to a fast leak that must be handled immediately or even autonomously by the satellite.CryoSat has gathered seven years of invaluable ice mapping data between 2016 and 2023. If operators had switched to the back-up thrusters immediately, and a series of very unlikely problems had occurred during the reconfiguration, these data would never have existed.But the longer they waited, the more fuel leaked out into space, and the fewer additional years they could gain by making the swap.21 November 2023 was selected as the day that balanced these two factors. What next? CRISTAL The swap to CryoSat’s back-up thrusters was a success. But we don’t yet know exactly how much this could extend the mission.Only by monitoring the fuel reserves over the next few days and weeks will the CryoSat team know if there are any smaller leaks or issues in the back-up system.In the best case, this operation could prove invaluable for humankind’s polar ice records.CryoSat has been a key part of what some have called the “golden age of satellite altimetry”. Amongst an impressive fleet, its radar altimeter is unique in being able to monitor ice and water levels in every part of the globe.CRISTAL, CryoSat''s natural successor, is not due to launch for another few years. The extension of CryoSat’s observations would bridge the gap and maintain the longest unbroken record of changing global ice we''ve ever had. CryoSat team photo - November 2023 Meanwhile, a novel collaboration with NASA''s ice monitoring satellite ICESat-2, which combines the orbits of ICESat-2 and CryoSat to map snow on ice – a significant cause of uncertainty in our estimates – could improve the accuracy of satellite measurements of ice volume yet further.The findings will be directly applicable also to future ice missions, including CRISTAL.With consistent improvements to CryoSat''s data products, which cover not just sea ice and land ice but polar oceans, coastal oceans and inland waters, ESA''s ice mission still has plenty to offer.

New, world leading, European technologies were developed to demonstrate the feasibility of an actively frequency stabilised QCL at 4.7 THz and provide improvement of the stabilisation loop with respect to passive stabilisation based on thermal and electrical bias control. This is essential for understanding the global distribution of atomic oxygen, and its critical impact on global climate change in the upper atmosphere, as well as the atomic oxygen induced corrosion of spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit. Supra-terahertz Harmonic Mixer Atomic oxygen is an important component of the Earth’s atmosphere. It is the most abundant species in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT) - a region of Earth’s atmosphere approximately 80 km to beyond 500 km in altitude – and is generated through the photolysis of molecular oxygen by ultraviolet radiation. Atomic oxygen is also an important factor to the energy budget and photochemistry of the MLT. Collisions with atomic oxygen and carbon dioxide leads to more efficient cooling and shrinking of the MLT, affecting global climate change as the concentration of carbon dioxide increases. The concentration of atomic oxygen is also affected by dynamical motions, vertical transport, tides, and winds. Accurate knowledge of the global distribution of atomic oxygen and its concentration profile, as well as diurnal and annual variations, is therefore essential for understanding the photochemistry, the energy budget and the dynamics of the MLT.Contract 4000125911 closed in 2022, after successfully raising the instrument’s technology readiness level from two (application formulated) to four (functional verification).

Circular life support systems will be key to make this happen. Do you have an idea for low-level readiness technologies for circular resourcing? ESA is offering an exciting opportunity to help shape the future of long duration crewed missions and off-Earth habitats. When astronauts return to the lunar surface or travel to Mars and beyond, they will have to grow food, filter CO2 and minimise waste, all in a harsh environment unfit for life. Creating a circular life support system is key, as relying only on resources from Earth would be costly, impractical and wasteful. Multi-compartment Pilot Plant The new ESA Campaign "Sustainable Future: Advancing Circular Life Support Systems" seeks to accelerate innovation in regenerative life support systems for space. "We want to find new ideas for commercialisation, which is expected to see a big growth in the next years, and for terrestrial applications. Bio-based plastic is just one example, but we are also talking about water, nutrient and food recycling," says Stephan Speidel, Technology Transfer Engineer at ESA and campaign lead."By opening this Campaign, ESA confirms its desire to be one of the key players for long-term human exploration. The work already done is the base for future development. Usually, it takes around ten years from identifying a technical challenge to finding a solution. By working with different partners and testing on Earth, we are able to speed up this process considerably at a much lower cost, which it is very useful," says Christophe Lasseur, ESA Head of MELiSSA Project and Life Support R&D Coordinator. Accelerating innovation Research into regenerative systems is not new for ESA. MELiSSA is one of the longest-running projects to create a closed-loop life support system – a self-sustainable ecosystem that ideally does not need resupplying. Started in 1989, the ESA-managed consortium is now an international multidisciplinary network of around fifty organisations from 14 European countries. While a full circular system for space still remains a complex challenge, the MELiSSA project remains a driving force to advance solutions in the near future."MEliSSA is a well known European project in circular economy and circular systems and the community is expanding. We are pleased to see the synergy with terrestrial challenges and we already have some success. Now is a good time to create partnerships, because we are approached more and more by commercial actors wishing to get involved and we are already exchanging technical data with some of them," says Christophe.The call is also a good opportunity to find out how stable the existing system is, by creating different terrestrial test beds, with less control. Is the system able to regulate itself or recover from the irregularities that might occur? How does the system behave for a large community of users? What are we looking for Space for a Green Future Stephan highlights: "We are searching for technologies and ideas that are on a low readiness scale, addressing three distinct challenges that we have mapped out with our partners. The campaign is in line with ESA''s vision, especially the Space for a Green Future Accelerator. It is also in line with European values, as we have a circular economy agenda in the EU and we have circular resource challenges in space."The campaign aims to identify ideas, technologies and methods to address the following challenges: What is the most profitable biomass composition How to deal with the non-degradable outputs of the MELiSSA loop Study the virus and phage risk on the regenerative life support processes Send us your ideas The Campaign is open until 29 January. Ideas will be evaluated in early 2024 and selected mission concepts will be invited for feasibility studies.This Campaign is being run by the Discovery element of ESA''s Basic Activities via the Open Space Innovation Platform (OSIP).

(Credit: CSA) Patches are an integral part of space culture. When a crew is assigned to a mission, NASA creates a patch for them. Usually, when an astronaut belongs to a space agency other than NASA, that agency also creates a personal patch for its crewmember. The patch reflects the mission objectives and some personal preferences of the astronaut who wears it proudly both on Earth and in space. Mission patches have been worn by NASA astronauts since 1965 and by Canadian Space Agency (CSA) astronauts since 1984, when the first Canadian flew in space. For CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen''s participation in the historic Artemis II mission to the Moon, his mission patch was graciously created by Anishinaabe artist Henry Guimond. It was done with the contribution of Dave Courchene III (Sabe), Leader of the Turtle Lodge in Sagkeeng First Nation (Manitoba). For the past decade, Jeremy has been fortunate to be invited by numerous Indigenous communities to sit with Elders and Knowledge Keepers. They have blessed him with knowledge and teachings that he carries with him as he prepares for his mission. These precious experiences have given Jeremy a profound appreciation for Indigenous ways of knowing. While the patch contains elements of Anishinaabe culture that do not reflect all First Nations, Inuit and Métis cultures, working with an Indigenous artist to create the patch he will wear with great humility as he represents our country in space was Jeremy''s way to recognize the importance of traditional knowledge and Indigenous Peoples of Canada. Original painting of Jeremy Hansen''s mission patch by Henry Guimond. (Credit: CSA) CSA President Lisa Campbell; Dave Courchene III, Leader of the Turtle Lodge; Henry Guimond, artist; CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen. (Credit: CSA) About the patch This patch was created for CSA astronaut Colonel Jeremy Hansen in honour of his participation in the historic Artemis II mission to the Moon by Anishinaabe artist Henry Guimond of the Turtle Lodge. The heptagonal shape and the animals are a reference to the Seven Sacred Laws, a traditional First Nations teaching shared with Jeremy in preparation for his journey around Grandmother Moon. This teaching is but one example of many rich and selfless teachings found in the diverse cultures of Indigenous Peoples, the first explorers. The bow represents Artemis, the twin sister of Apollo, the Greek goddess of the hunt, nature, and the Moon. Artemis launches her arrow with the astronauts, sending them around Grandmother Moon who conveys the cycle of life. It is said that she watches over the waters of Earth, regulates the tides and feeds life. The arrow launches from Turtle Island, which refers to the continent of North America in the creation stories of some Indigenous peoples. The Royal Canadian Air Force astronaut wings are symbolic of the Canadian Armed Forces'' role in Canada''s journey to the Moon and recognize the sacrifice of Jeremy''s fellow service members and their families. The Canadian flag at the top pays tribute to the thousands of people who have worked across our country to make this mission possible, but also to symbolically bring all Canadians along on this mission around the Moon. The Big Dipper and the North Star, easily recognizable in the night sky of the northern hemisphere, are a reminder that humanity exists amongst an unimaginably expansive universe, as the stars visible to the human eye in our night sky are limited to only those of the Milky Way, our galaxy. Starting with Indigenous peoples, explorers have used these visible stars for navigation, and astronauts continue to navigate by them in deep space. The North Star is shown as a five-pointed star to represent the five members of the Hansen family as well as Texas, where Jeremy and his family have been living since he was recruited as a CSA astronaut. The silver border represents the Orion capsule that will support the crew on their journey. The CSA is fittingly represented within this border as well to honour the extraordinary efforts of both its past and present members to support space exploration and bring its benefits back to humanity. Inside the silver border is a thin blue line. The blue represents the light or spirit that is in all of us – in all humankind, plants and animals. This spirit will travel with the crew aboard the capsule. Jeremy Hansen''s mission patch: recognizing Indigenous Peoples The Seven Sacred Laws The heptagonal shape of the patch is a reference to the Seven Sacred Laws, or Seven Grandfather Teachings. The Seven Sacred Laws are ancestral values that inspire our conduct as human beings, and bring us back to a relationship with Mother Earth. They are represented by seven animals. Each animal offers a special gift and understanding of how we as people can live in harmony with one another. What each animal symbolizes, as shared with us by Sabe, Leader of Turtle Lodge (edited for concision): Buffalo – Respect The buffalo represents respect. It gives its entire being to feed the people, for them to live. Elders teach that when you respect others, you give of yourself, you give your life to help people around you to create a better existence for all. Eagle – Love The eagle represents love. Grandmothers say that one of the most powerful medicines we have is love, that love is a powerful healer. The eagle also symbolizes vision and sight. It is important to see ahead, to have a vision of one''s purpose and to work towards it. Elders teach that one''s true purpose is always rooted in love and in support of others. Bear – Courage A very physically powerful animal, the bear represents courage. A mother bear is fearless in the protection of her cubs. It is natural for her to display courage and strength, to do what is right in life. It is not always easy to face challenges, follow one''s purpose and do the right thing. Only with the courage and resilience of the bear will you be able to face and overcome the challenges that could prevent you from living out your life''s purpose. Bigfoot – Honesty Sasquatch or Bigfoot – Sabe or “giant” in the Ojibway language – represents the importance of honesty and being true to one''s word. Say what you mean and be honest with yourself and others. Elders often exemplify this trait; when they say something, their word is a commitment and can be counted upon. Honesty is also speaking true and good words about others and avoiding gossip. Beaver – Wisdom The beaver represents wisdom. It has an incredible gift to build and create, as well as the wisdom of how to use this gift. The beaver''s creation harnesses life-giving water to create important ecosystems that support and enable life. It can even channel water back into an area following a devastating forest fire, renewing and revitalizing that ecosystem. Like the beaver, we all have a special gift to offer others. Use the wisdom of the beaver to acknowledge your gifts and put them to use in the service of others: this is the source of life satisfaction and happiness. Wolf – Humility The wolf represents humility, acknowledging that there is a higher power and natural laws governing the universe. Showing gratitude for our life and our existence, while acknowledging that we are all equal is a sign of humility. The sun shines on us all equally, and no one is better or less than others. Turtle – Truth The turtle is truth. The Elders say that in order to know and understand truth, we have to learn to understand the six other teachings: respect, love, courage, honesty, wisdom, humility. The turtle leaves a trail, truth, for us to follow. As we are constantly faced with challenges, we should do our best to follow that trail and live truthfully. In the original artwork, we can also see Henry''s interpretation of the universe in the background: the way it looks, the way it moves. Kinanakominigo (our deep thanks from the heart) to Henry and Sabe for working with Jeremy and our team, and graciously sharing their knowledge and teachings. About Henry Guimond Henry Guimond is an artist born and raised on the Sagkeeng First Nation, Manitoba. His artwork is featured in the Canadian Museum for Human Rights and in many homes and businesses in the community. Henry has a special talent for painting traditional names.

Ensuring crew safety is the primary driver for these schedule changes. NASA now targets September 2025 for Artemis II, the first crewed Artemis mission, which will see CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen become the first Canadian to fly around the Moon. Jeremy and Jenni Gibbons, Canada''s backup for Artemis II, continue to train and will be ready whenever required. Artemis III, which is planned to land the first astronauts near the lunar south pole, will launch in September 2026. Artemis IV, the first mission to the Lunar Gateway, remains on track for 2028. NASA''s testing to qualify components to keep the crew safe and ensure mission success has uncovered issues that require additional time to resolve. Teams are troubleshooting a battery issue and addressing challenges with a circuitry component responsible for air ventilation and temperature control. NASA''s investigation into the unexpected loss of char layer pieces from the Orion spacecraft''s heat shield during Artemis I is expected to conclude this spring. Teams have taken a methodical approach to understand the issue, including extensive sampling of the heat shield, testing, and review of data from sensors and imagery. With Artemis, NASA and its partners, including the CSA, will explore more of the Moon than ever before, learn how to live and work away from home, and prepare for future human exploration of Mars.

Who inspired him? Learn more about Canadian Space Agency astronaut Joshua Kutryk. Expand all Collapse all Space and exploration Why did you want to become an astronaut? As a child I was fascinated with space. I knew that my life would focus on helping explore it. As an adult, I realize human space exploration is important to us all – as individuals and as Canadians. I have always wanted to leave the world a better place than I found it, and I believe that space is one area where I can do this. I want to serve Canadians in a way that fits with my skills and interests. I want to inspire them. I want to help humanity broaden its collective horizon. Work and studies What motivated you to study in your field? Physics and math were my favourite subjects in high school – I was continually amazed by how those subjects explained the world around me. I couldn''t fly to space as a child, but I could fly into the atmosphere. I went for a ride in a light aircraft when I was just nine years old. When we landed I knew that I wanted to fly, and that I wanted to understand in detail the science and engineering that made flying possible. I was inspired. My motivation to study aerospace at the highest levels was set. What did you like best about your job as a test pilot? As a test pilot, I had a job that combined two of my favourite things: engineering and high-performance flying. I like the challenges of testing new technical systems aboard high-performance jets, and I especially like the teamwork that goes into solving those challenges. I got to work with aerospace engineers, analysts, aircraft technicians, program managers and corporate executives, all with the goal of making the F-18 safer and more effective. What do you consider your greatest achievement? Overall, it would be the good balance I am (usually) able to maintain among a challenging variety of family, professional and personal endeavours. Achieving balance in life is difficult, and I try very hard to make that my priority. I am proud of the different experiences I have had and feel lucky to have had them. Advice and inspiration What is your motto? Never despair. What is the best career advice you''ve ever received? Throughout my life, my father would encourage me to seek out new experiences. He believed that pursuing a wide breadth of experience was the key to success. As a child, this meant participating in a lot of extracurricular and community activities, even ones that didn''t interest me at the time. As an adult, this advice has served me well, both professionally and personally. I have learned to embrace new, unknown experiences and not to fear them. This advice remains a big factor in all my career decisions. Think back to a teacher who had a positive impact on your life. What did she/he do to influence you? When I was in grade six, my teacher (his name was Ted) had just returned to Canada following an extended cycling trip through India. This gave me a glimpse at the kind of exploratory and adventurous life I wanted to live. His stories of riding a bike across a foreign country inspired me and had a very real effect on later decisions I would make. In fact, I still stay in touch with him. He is a principal now at a school in Whitehorse, Yukon, where I was fortunate enough to spend a few of my childhood years. Which living person do you most admire? Or who are your heroes in real life? Role models have played an important part in my life. I admire the Canadian astronauts and trailblazers who came before me. When I was a teenager, Neil Armstrong left a big impression on me because he combined academic rigour with test flying to help take humans to the Moon.

(Credit: AetheraTM Technologies) 2023-10-31 In 2018, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) awarded a contribution worth $1.5 million to a small Halifax-based company called AetheraTM Technologies. This Announcement of Opportunity (AO) was the first to include a dedicated section for small businesses, a strategic decision to help diversify Canada''s space sector and help small firms scale up to space readiness. AetheraTM is a radiofrequency (RF) engineering company, whose products include solid-state RF generators that are used in a number of fields including food and mass timber. The AetheraTM team saw the AO as an opportunity to branch out their technology for space. They successfully proposed a project to adapt it to operate in the vacuum of space and to be integrated into Ad Astra Rocket Company''s Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR®) for advanced in-space electric propulsion. The CSA''s Space Technology Development Program team supported AetheraTM throughout the contribution and advocated for the CSA to give them additional time to complete their project during the pandemic. This eventually paid off: their technology was tested successfully per the mandate received by NASA and will now be on Ad Astra''s rockets to become a possible candidate for NASA''s NextSTEP program.

Canadian engineers at the Canada''s Defence Research Telecommunications Establishment Ottawa reduction center check equipment used to process Alouette data. (Credit: NASA, "Alouette: Canada''s First Satellite – NASA Facts,"" 1964) Some doubted that Canada''s first satellite would even work. But at a time when satellites were designed and expected to last only a few months, Alouette-I transmitted data for over 10 years, outlasting any other satellite of its era! Launched on September 29, 1962, Alouette-I was the first satellite to be completely designed and built by a country other than the USSR or the USA.

(Credit: CSA, NASA) Much has been written about the scientific and engineering legacy of Alouette-I over the years. Its scientific results contributed greatly to the development of long-distance communications, among other things, that we often take for granted today. Yet, decades later, the data was nearly lost, if not for the foresight and effort to save it. Now, the data has been extracted, processed and digitized. It could be used with today''s computational methods to produce a more comprehensive model of Earth''s ionosphere in the 1960s, or for any other scientific or creative purposes not thought of yet. Making ionograms Alouette-I''s data was processed at the Canada''s Defence Research Telecommunications Establishment (DRTE). The data processing facility was located at the Shirleys Bay campus close to Ottawa. This is where technicians would listen to Alouette-I''s signal and process tapes of data. Their job was to produce ionograms, which depict the reflections of radio waves emitted from the satellite off the top side of the ionosphere. The ionograms were recorded on 35 mm film. Ionogram recorded on 35 mm film. (Credit: CSA) Thanks to a large network of international ground stations collecting the data, there were thousands of tapes coming in daily shipments, from Quito, Ecuador; Woomera, Australia; and Resolute Bay in the Canadian Arctic, to name just a few. The DRTE data processing facility was the only place in the world that could produce high-quality ionograms. It operated 70 hours a week, and in its first six years processed and recorded about 2.3 million ionograms!

(Credit: CSA) Why was there so much data from Alouette-I? The simple answer: the mission lasted a long time. Among the design choices that led to the exceptional longevity of the satellite was a very high standard of quality control. Colin Franklin, Alouette-I''s chief electrical engineer, and his team, realized that commercial semiconductor transistors did not have the quality needed for space applications. So, they worked with manufacturers to make transistors and circuits that could operate under great temperature and power supply variations. The team also took the bold approach of making the transmitter power 10 times greater than the minimum required. According to Franklin, “This was a milestone decision that eased the antenna design and the mass production of high-quality ionograms.” Play Mute Volume Current position:00:00:00 Total time:--:--:-- Show closed captioning Enter full screen Listen to Colin Franklin on the design challenges of Canada''s first satellite Alouette-I. (Credit: CSA) Despite the team''s remarkable dedication, some doubted the satellite would even work. "At the working level, we had no idea that others thought we couldn''t do it. Never once were we told that what we were doing was impossible,"" said the 95-year-old Colin Franklin at a Canadian Space Agency event, in 2023. On July 9, 1962, just a few months before the launch of Alouette-I, a 1.4-megaton high-altitude nuclear experiment was conducted over Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. This nuclear experiment, called Starfish Prime, caused significant declines in performance on other satellites operating at the time. Because of this, there was less faith in Alouette-I''s success. And yet Alouette-I survived and outlasted its contemporaries. This is mostly due to its power supply, which was designed with a tolerance for up to 40% degradation in solar cell power. The team''s focus on reliability proved to be visionary: no one expected that the satellite would need to withstand artificial radiation created by a hydrogen bomb. Saving the Alouette data: 1990s to today In 1993, Colin Franklin delivered a speech during an international award ceremony held by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. At the end of his speech, he wondered aloud: “The Alouette/ISIS program produced a mountain of some 50,000 analogue tapes of topside sounder data. Is anyone going to digitize and preserve these for the archives, or are they simply going to be thrown out? A question for the Canadian Space Agency and perhaps the Communications Research Centre to ponder.” Colin Franklin Franklin was referring to the original tapes, recorded at international ground stations and shipped to Ottawa for processing into ionograms. By 1993, many of the Alouette/ISIS tapes were past their shelf life and were thus at risk of being destroyed. Nearly 30,000 35 mm negative film rolls, containing ionograms from Alouette-I, Alouette-II, and ISIS. These were stored at Library and Archives Canada, in Ottawa. (Credit: CSA) In 1996, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center initiated a digitization process. Unfortunately, the data restoration effort included only two tapes from Alouette-I, as their tapes had either already been destroyed or were significantly degraded. The 35 mm film rolls that were produced at the DRTE could last 35 years in dark storage. By 2010, the Alouette-I and other Alouette/ISIS film rolls had been in storage for over 40 years. Once again, the data was at risk of being destroyed. The CSA took ownership of the nearly 30,000 film rolls and pushed for their digitization before they could significantly degrade. By 2017 the CSA contracted a firm to digitize the film. Starting with Alouette-I, the digitization effort resulted in 5054 film rolls scanned, yielding 1,612,104 images of ionograms. That year, the CSA collaborated in NASA''s Space Apps Challenge for the first time. A team of math and engineering students from the University of Waterloo won the award by developing a way to read the metadata. Over the next few years, a CSA team developed a data extraction algorithm. Left: extracted mapped datapoints. Right: the corresponding scanned image of the ionogram. (Credit: CSA) By 2023, the team was able to process all available Alouette-I images. This was made possible thanks to the Agency''s in-house high-performance virtual computing environment. In this process, a new metadata format was realized. To read this new format, an AI-based text-recognition algorithm was employed to read the numbers directly from the scanned images. Ultimately, 693,677 scanned images were fully read and processed! Historical and cultural significance of Alouette-I data Today, there are satellites and instruments that offer new insight into the ionosphere and space weather processes. But no satellite can provide what Alouette-I data contains: a glimpse into the 1960s ionosphere, at a time where satellites were few and far between. This data, once reserved for scientists, is now available to all, and can be re-analyzed using computers vastly more capable than those at the time.

(Credit: CSA) Alouette-I still orbits Earth at an altitude of about 1000 km. The films, the scanned images, and the extracted data are a testament to Canada''s pioneering work in the 1960s. Physical and informational artifacts such as these are important to Canadians today, and for generations to come.

Jeremy and Christina are scheduled to fly on Artemis II, the first crewed mission to the Moon in over 50 years. The group spent most of the week exploring Kamestastin, a remote meteorite impact crater in northern Labrador, near the Quebec border, for planetary science and lunar geology training. CSA astronauts Jeremy Hansen and Jenni Gibbons listen to Dr. Gordon Osinski, who led this geology field training.

In addition to the four astronauts, he was accompanied by NASA spacewalk and science trainers and Western University students. Dr. Gordon Osinski during a teaching moment where he compared the Tycho lunar crater to the Kamestastin crater. (Credit: CSA) The Kamestastin crater (also known as Mistastin) lies within the traditional hunting grounds of the Mushuau Innu First Nation and is one of 31 impact craters in Canada. Created some 36 million years ago north of the 55th parallel, and at 28 kilometres in diameter, it is a crucial training ground as we return humans to the Moon, because it is the best representation we have on Earth of what astronauts will find there. The crater contains anorthosite, a rarity on Earth, but abundant on the Moon. Fun fact: The lake was first identified as a possible impact crater in 1968 in the Nature science magazine, after being viewed from space. We would like to sincerely thank the Innu Nation for graciously allowing Jeremy and Jenni, and our colleagues from Western University and NASA, to enter their territory to explore and train students and astronauts at Kamestastin crater. A special thank you to Innu Guardians David Nui, Hank Rich and Sebastian Piwas from Natuashish for guiding the group and sharing their stories and knowledge of Kamestastin and the Innu Nation.

Future Moon explorers will be required to choose the best rock samples to bring back with them to maximize the scientific return back on Earth. The group had a very full agenda practising geology in a genuine meteorite impact crater – the closest thing we have to the Moon here on Earth. They worked on: Identifying the best instruments and techniques for geological exploits on the lunar surface Sampling impact melt and an enigmatic rock known as anorthosite, a rock that is rare on Earth, but covers about 80% of the lunar surface Learning impact cratering processes and products in lunar-relevant target rocks Practising spacewalking techniques including navigation in lunar geologic scales, traverse building and execution in lunar analogue terrain Testing geology tools CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen and his Artemis II crewmate, NASA astronaut Christina Koch, sample rocks using rock hammers during a field geology training expedition in northern Labrador. (Credit: CSA) But why do Jeremy and Christina need to learn all of this even if their mission doesn’t land on the Moon, you might ask? This training not only equips them to decipher lunar geology during Artemis II to prepare them for lunar observations and photography, but also paves the way for upcoming Artemis missions, potentially leading to remarkable lunar exploration. These types of expeditions are similar to space missions in that you need to bring all of your equipment and food with you, with very few or no chance of resupply. Once you are there, you need to be fully independent in case of emergency (except for major injuries) until your plane can pick you up – IF the weather cooperates! (Credit: Gordon Osinski) They also got to work on various other skills that are transferrable to any space mission, for example: Expeditionary skills: logistics and safety, navigation and mapping, mission stressors Teambuilding and leadership: team dynamics to accomplish authentic science objectives, group challenges, communication development Despite the many black flies and mosquitoes (thankfully not an issue in space!) and a challenging environment to live and work in, the group had a tremendous experience learning as we prepare, along our international partners, for future Moon missions.

(Credit: CSA) 2023-08-09 The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the launch of SCISAT, an entirely Canadian satellite mission designed to help study the ozone layer and the substances that deplete it. Originally intended to last two years, the satellite has far exceeded expectations. It is still operational and performing as it should, and all signs point to continued success. SCISAT measures 70 different substances in the atmosphere and establishes profiles of temperature and wind speeds. The science teams in charge of data processing are continually improving their methods in order to validate the data and extract even more information from it. More relevant than ever, 20 years later Thanks to recent advances, SCISAT has been able to detect a number of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These powerful greenhouse gases are controlled substances. In addition, SCISAT shed light on a new way in which stratospheric ozone is being destroyed, involving aerosols and chlorine. This discovery was made after the 2019–2020 Australian bushfires, during which a large amount of smoke was injected into the stratosphere. In January 2022, SCISAT was used to detect and monitor water vapour injected into the stratosphere when the Hunga Tonga volcano erupted. It was found that the water was from marine sources rather than the atmosphere. Learning more about climate change SCISAT data on many molecules can be studied to better understand atmospheric chemistry, which is directly related to climate change. By measuring greenhouse gases and aerosols (fine particles), the satellite provides a deeper understanding of the atmosphere''s energy balance, a key source of uncertainty in climate models. To mark the anniversary of SCISAT, scientists, government officials, industry representatives and policy makers will attend an event from October 16 to 18, 2023, at CSA headquarters in Longueuil, Quebec.

The Arctic is warming at about three times the average rate of other regions on Earth. As a result, the rate of ice and snow melt is increasing, along with other environmental changes. These changes affect ecosystems in the North, like boreal forests, but also the global climate. Meanwhile, human activities in other areas around the world are contributing to the warming trend in the Arctic. The world needs to know as much as possible about climate shifts going on in the North to inform government decisions regarding climate change. In collaboration with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) is leading an international Earth observation mission concept to put two satellites into orbit that could observe the Arctic like never before. The Arctic Observing Mission aims to give scientists a new view of weather and climate patterns. It could deliver major benefits for people living in northern communities, including Indigenous peoples, by increasing safety and quality of life thanks to improved weather and air quality forecasts. It would also provide humanity with valuable information about climate change. The RCM''s one millionth image, acquired on March 30, 2023. This image of the Canadian Arctic shows the tip of Borden Peninsula and Brodeur Peninsula, on Baffin Island, as well as Devon Island in Nunavut. (Source : Imagerie de la mission de la Constellation RADARSAT © Gouvernement du Canada [2023]. RADARSAT est une marque officielle de l''Agence spatiale canadienne.) Four key instruments CSA and ECCC experts, in collaboration with an industry team, are working on designs for the two spacecraft and instruments and are putting together an overall plan for how the mission would operate. Four key instruments are considered for the satellites: A meteorological imager This instrument, an advanced baseline imager, aims to give meteorologists better observations over the Arctic in order to improve weather forecasting. For people living in the Arctic and neighbouring regions, this means having more accurate weather data, which is crucial for their safety and well-being. A greenhouse gas imaging Fourier transform spectrometer This innovative instrument aims to measure the concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, as well as pollutants like carbon monoxide. It would track gases and pollutants in the atmosphere so we can monitor their natural cycles, as well as changes caused by expanding industries in the North, climate impacts on forests and tundra, or the release of carbon dioxide and methane due to permafrost thaw. A dispersive spectrometer for air quality observations This instrument would observe gases affecting air quality, such as emissions from wildfires and pollution from cities and industry. Today, Canada relies on ground-based instruments to make these observations. Satellite data would improve how air quality is forecasted, providing a major benefit for all and particularly for people whose health is more sensitive to changes in air quality. A collection of space weather instruments (auroral imager, particle sensors and magnetometer) Space weather refers to the conditions in the area of space close to Earth, especially electromagnetic radiation and charged particles that come from the Sun during solar flares. These instruments aim to improve space weather forecasting in order to better protect satellites and other ground-based infrastructures. Monitoring the permafrost Permafrost is one major example of a feature in Arctic ecosystems that we need to study closely. Thawing permafrost could be a major threat facing humanity. Permafrost stores nearly twice as much carbon as Earth''s atmosphere. As it thaws, it releases carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere, which causes temperatures to rise further and melt the permafrost even more quickly. The Arctic Observing Mission would help scientists monitor the permafrost so researchers and policy makers can make decisions based on the highest-quality data. As an Arctic country, Canada has a responsibility to focus on missions in this region. The world''s most detailed view of the Arctic The Arctic Observing Mission would be a game changer: it could provide data about the atmosphere and situation on the ground in the Arctic in more detail (spatial resolution) and more frequently (temporal resolution) than existing satellites can. Currently, low Earth orbit satellites are able to see the Arctic, so they have good spatial resolution. However, their orbits prevent them from reporting on atmosphere and surface details as frequently as the Arctic Observing Mission would. Geostationary satellites currently orbiting Earth''s equator are able to provide continuous observation – which means they have good temporal resolution – but they cannot see above the 60 degrees North latitude. The Arctic Observing Mission concept addresses the spatial/temporal gap by passing directly over the Arctic in a highly elliptical orbit. This type of orbit would enable the satellites to spend most of their time over the Arctic making detailed observations.

International partnerships As experts at the CSA and ECCC continue to develop plans for the Arctic Observing Mission, they are working with potential international partners in the United States and Europe to determine how these potential partners might contribute to the mission.

We were blown away by the amazing solutions imagined by young Canadians for the first edition of our Space Brain Hack. The theme this year related to mental health. We asked them to think of ways to: provide astronauts with sensory simulation and a virtual escape from their work and stressful environment; or help them maintain connection with family and friends and with the home planet. All submissions were evaluated on the basis of four criteria: communication; innovation; validity; and critical thinking/critical analysis. A panel of CSA experts then did a blind review and ranked the top submissions. Below are short summaries of the top submissions for each category (grades 6 to 8 and grades 9 to 12). Spoiler alert: these summaries do not do justice to the in-depth work done by the participants. As a team or individually, they learned about the life of astronauts in space and mental health, did extensive research, brainstormed, discussed with experts to validate their idea and its feasibility, reflected on how to best adapt it to the space environment, and thought of creative terrestrial applications for their proposed solutions. Many even went above and beyond what was requested, providing videos and creating prototypes. While these were not assessed, it showed us once again how curious, engaged and creative young Canadians are. You inspire us! Thank you to all the participants and to the many educators who facilitated the activity. Well done! And congratulations to everyone whose submission made it to the top, especially our grand prize winners: Bhavishyaa from Oakville, Ontario, for PeaceMaker (grades 6 to 8 category) Maya from Calgary, Alberta, for Cosmic Companions: Digital Pets in Space (grades 9 to 12 category) The grand prize winners of the Space Brain Hack, Bhavi (left) and Maya. (Credit: provided by the families) The top three winners for each category will be invited to take part in a virtual working session with CSA experts, during which they will present their solution to the experts and the other winners and receive feedback about their idea. Bhavishyaa and Maya win a virtual visit from a CSA expert or astronaut. We can''t wait to see what young Canadians will imagine in the next edition of the Space Brain Hack! Details and the theme will be announced in the fall. Stay tuned! Note: The drawings appear in the language in which they were submitted. Grades 6 to 8 FIRST PLACE: PeaceMaker Bhavishyaa Grade 6 Oakville, Ontario Bhavishyaa proposes a VR headset that includes stereo sound, detection gloves and preprogrammed places on Earth that the astronaut is fond of. The headset would also use brain wave analysis to monitor the astronaut''s emotions and automatically change the setting to relax their mind if required. The technology could be adapted for people who are struggling during periods of isolation (e.g. snowstorms, seasonal changes, viruses). SECOND PLACE: Comical mission Lea, Lily and their colleagues Grade 6 Bibliothèque Georges-Brossard/Maison des jeunes de Saint-Bruno Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, Quebec This solution is based on a game called "exquisite corpse." It aims to make astronauts feel less lonely through the use of communication and game apps, and will bring lots of fun to their daily lives. The proposed games feature drawings and stories that are zany, unexpected, magical and hilarious. Players will participate in comic jams, complete stories without knowing the beginning, and rearrange famous characters cut into three interchangeable parts (head, torso, legs)! These games can be played initially by the astronauts and their family and friends, but can then be opened up to everyone. That way, the public will able to follow along on the space journey while providing drawings and stories that alleviate the crew''s anxiety by making them laugh. The more the merrier! THIRD PLACE: Telepresence Robot Areeb Grade 7 Ottawa, Ontario Text version: Redesigned Atlas (telepresence robot) VR headset Exoskeleton The solution proposed combines virtual reality, an exoskeleton and telepresence robots. This will allow astronauts to "physically" interact with people on Earth, helping maintain their social and physical connections with family and friends. The robot could perform a wide range of actions, and have sensors to give it human-like senses and touch. Its movements would be controlled by an exoskeleton donned by the astronaut in space and have a screen on its face to project the astronaut''s face, allowing more personal interactions. A VR headset would allow the astronaut''s facial reaction to be projected onto the robot''s screen face and receiving feedback as well. 4 – Multi Task Mutt Rio, Varana, Anjali Grade 6 Macville Public School Bolton, Ontario Text version: Fur/dusting part (to be placed everywhere except eyes and nose) Camera for eyes Movement joints (mj) Feet joints (fj) Data compartment/power source Multi Task Mutt is a robotic mental health support dog with fur spots to be pet, but that can also help with chores in space (e.g. vacuuming, dusting, capturing images). The robotic support dog would have its own dedicated magnetic station on board making its presence known and providing comfort to the astronauts. The goal is to make astronauts'' daily tasks easier, but also give time to focus on other aspects of their well-being in space. 5 – Mission Sleep Diya, Samreen, Tamanna Grade 6 Macville Public School Bolton, Ontario Text version: Astronaut Light shining during sunrise (morning) Light shining during sunset (afternoon) Size of lights can be adjusted based on available space in spacecraft Emergency button to run lights on/off (note: there are two emergency buttons on the drawing) Will be 56 lights in total Roof can be made with reflective material to reflect light Microchip inside is connected to weather satellite so light can change colours based on satellite''s message At night, lights turn pale white to mimic Moon phases Space where crewmembers stay Emergency button to turn lights on/off (note: there are two emergency buttons on the drawing) The team proposes using a series of lights that can mimic Earth''s rhythms and Moon phases in order to help with astronauts'' sleep and circadian rhythms. This device will be programmed to adjust the colour and dimness of the light to the time of day on Earth from where the rocket was launched. The goal of this device is to address the lack of sleep that astronauts may experience during the Artemis missions and on board the Orion spacecraft. 6 – VR Hiking Parker, Wesley, Isaac Grade 8 Fisher Park Summit Alternative Public School Ottawa, Ontario Text version: Treadmill VR headset In order to simulate a walk or a hike, beautiful landscapes will be displayed in a virtual reality headset while the astronaut is on the treadmill. It will be a very realistic experience that can relieve stress, increase heart rate and improve fitness. 7 – Solar Lamp Therapy Grace, Ebunoluwa, Olumorewa, Chinemerem, Chikanyima, Randy Grade 6-7-8 Imhotep''s Legacy Academy, Dalhousie University Halifax, Nova Scotia This solar light or lamp would help with astronauts'' mood, sleep, and mental/emotional health in space. It would mimic sunlight and provide much-needed vitamin D, to regulate astronauts'' sleep cycles and inner clock, but also facilitate their rehabilitation when they come back to Earth. 8 – Digital Brain Harliv and Jaden Grade 6 Lambeth Public School London, Ontario Text version: Astronaut Thought bubbles: "This is relaxing" "And fun" iPad Pro Drawing app Apple pen This solution encourages astronauts to take part in creative activities such as digital art and drawing to express their emotions through art using a digital pen. Dedicating a couple of hours or more, astronauts can also share their art with fellow crewmembers. Digital art can help with astronauts'' stress levels and make them calmer and focus better on their tasks. 9 – Contenant de calme/Calm Crate Sofie, Hailey, Valeria Gradev8 Fisher Park Summit Alternative Public School Ottawa, Ontario Text version: Les activités dans le paquet Le paquet pour astronaute dans l''espace (on the gift box) Sofie, Hailey, and Valeria propose sending a personalized package to astronauts made up of different calming activities, such as colouring books, and other stimulating activities like a Rubik''s cube and engineering activity kits. The goal is to provide astronauts with a variety of ways to spend their time on a daily basis. 10 – Space bicycle Kien, Jayden, Ariyan, Alex Grade 8 Fisher Park Summit Alternative Public School Ottawa, Ontario Text version: VR headset Exercise bike What you see This solution uses virtual reality and a stationary bike to simulate a ride through nature. This solution will enable the user to ride on a bike path and improve their mental health. Music can enhance the experience. Grades 9 to 12 FIRST PLACE: Cosmic Companions: Digital Pets in Space Maya Grade 10 Calgary, Alberta Text version: Robotic cat shares similar sensors and features as the robotic dog Visual sensors – eyes display emotions Audio sensors Touch sensors Movable tail – displays emotions Movable neck – to nod or shake head More traditional colours (orange tabby cat) Customizable colours and features More colourful and untraditional for a dog Maya proposes a solution that combines robotics and virtual technology to address issues caused by prolonged isolation and lack of sensory stimuli in space. The digital pets would be an AI assistant for the astronauts who could not only interact with and train their pets to combat boredom, but could also access multimedia content, such as music, movies, documentaries, and audio files that are unique to their preferences. Additionally, the robotic pets could remind the astronauts of important events and tasks. The use of robotic pets could be beneficial to the well-being and mental health of the elderly or bedridden population, who may experience loneliness and might not have the physical capability or resources to own, feed, walk or care for a real pet. Children with conditions like autism and Down syndrome can benefit from having a non-allergenic robotic pet as it provides comfort and social stimulation. SECOND PLACE: The Musk of "Nose-talgia" Sadie Grade 9 Stittsville, Ontario Text version: Portable unit containing: Papers with scents Fans Water source Power source Nasal cannula Flexible tube VR headset playing photos and videos The sense of smell can trigger memories. Sadie proposes to use scent to unlock positive emotions in astronauts to help maintain their mental wellness while on missions. This would be done using VR headsets with pre-programmed videos and photos from the astronaut''s life and technology that would distribute the scents to match the images on the VR headset. The goal is to use scent combined with visual imagery to bring back nostalgia and create a positive enhanced emotional response. THIRD PLACE: Virtual Reality: Our Solution to Improving Mental Health of Astronauts Karen Grade 9 Homeschooled Calgary, Alberta Text version: VR headset Headpiece with electrodes and moistening systems Screen view System updates Game mode Night mode Virtual reality room Padded walls VR headset storage Harness Treadmill Karen proposes to use a VR system with handheld controllers for astronauts to exercise, play video games with friends, build teamwork, and increase mental stimulation in space. This VR system would require only a small, dedicated space in order to navigate through a digital world. This VR could be motivational, rewarding, and fun for astronauts. 4 – The Journey of Bringing Earth to Space Maya Grade 10 Calgary, Alberta Text version: Mars in all its beauty Lounging chairs Lighting Man wearing VR headset Recreational room would be able to accommodate more than two lounging chairs The solution involves providing personalized digital content based on the astronaut''s preferences, such as nature documentaries, relaxation techniques, favourite places, music and art therapy, through a tablet or similar device. A private, customizable recreational room equipped with virtual reality technology could also be created to deliver the same content and make it feel more like home. This VR room would be separate from work and activity areas to avoid mixing work and relaxation periods. It would have noise-cancelling properties, minimal lights to prevent disruptions to the astronaut''s circadian rhythm, comfortable lounging chairs, and a specific temperature to ensure comfort. 5 – StellarAI Shivam Grade 10 Brampton, Ontario Text version: StellarAI StellarAI Bot Simulation: sample run in woods through lens of VR Camera VR headset Handset Movement stand: fluid movement 360 degrees Shivam would like to introduce StellarAI, a virtual reality AI bot to maintain both good mental health and a healthy physique through a virtual 3D space. Astronauts will be able to interact with a fully integrated chatbot that measures stress levels and the mental health of the astronaut. It generates responses and activities for the astronaut to do based on this data. Through the 3D interface, astronauts can also virtually interact with their family on Earth. StellarAI is trained and equipped with vast amounts of code and a database of information from Earth. It assesses the individual with head, hand and body sensors. It can have a conversation with the user and direct them to a virtual reality experience like going for a run, playing a sport, or speaking with their family based on the diagnostic made.

(Credit: Canadian Space Agency) 2023-07-20 The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) announced recently that Canada was joining the ESA''s Space Safety Programme, which aims to address the challenge of protecting space infrastructure in a global context that becomes more complex every day. This participation will make Canadian organizations eligible for contracts related to this specific programme for the first time. Following the Ministerial Council of ESA held last November and consultations with the space industry, academia and other government departments, the CSA also confirmed new investments totalling €35.1 million (equivalent to approximately $60 million in 2022) in ESA programmes that have been strategically selected as areas most likely to benefit the Canadian space sector and scientific community: Earth observation, satellite communications, human and robotic exploration, and technology development. Summary of Canada''s investments Amounts Earth observation €12.8M (≈$27.4M) Future EO, Period 1, Segment 2 €8.7M (≈$16.2M) Copernicus Space Component – Segment 4 (CSC-4) Phase 2 €1.7M (≈$3.3M) Earth Watch – CLIMATE-SPACE €1.5M (≈$2.7M) Earth Watch – Altius €0.9M (≈$1.6M) General Support Technology Programme €1.8M (≈$2.7M) Terra Novae (European Exploration Envelope Programme) Period 3 €3.0M (≈$5.4M) NAVISP Phase 3, Element 2 (Navigation) €1.2M (≈$2.2M) ARTES 4.0 (Telecommunications) €13.2M (≈$24.6M) Space Safety Programme €3.1M (≈$5.7M) These investments are all aligned with the Space Strategy for Canada. Canada and ESA have been cooperating in space activities for over 40 years in order to provide Canadian organizations with access to European markets, and to foster collaboration in science. Past investments in ESA have resulted in opportunities for Canadian companies worth almost three times the value of the initial contract. The partnership also provides Canada''s space sector with access to data from ESA missions and infrastructure. In June 2019, Canada renewed its treaty-level agreement with ESA until 2030.

His visit started by meeting Cisco, his trusty ride for the Calgary Stampede Parade. All the while, Lisa Campbell, President of the CSA, and Stéphanie Durand, Vice-President, Space Program Policy, met with space health research leads to visit state-of-the-art laboratories at the University of Calgary. The university is leveraging investments made by the CSA for applications in health and other fields that benefit people on Earth. Later in the day, an Independence Day celebration took place at the residence of the U.S. Consul General Holly Waeger Monster in the company of NASA Administrator Bill Nelson where the longstanding space collaboration between Canada and the U.S. was highlighted. Jeremy, the Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister responsible for the CSA, and Lisa Campbell also addressed the guests. The following day, Jeremy took on his role as Parade Marshal, put on his cowboy hat and boots, and led the Calgary Stampede Parade. He rode alongside the Honorary Parade Marshal General Wayne Eyre, Chief of the Defence Staff. Jeremy and the CSA-NASA delegation also visited the Elbow River Camp, a place that has served as a gathering place for First Nations people during the Stampede since 1912, and where they can participate in traditional dancing, share their cultures with others, and celebrate their heritage. Jeremy and guests experienced the cultures of the Kainai, Piikani, Siksika, Stoney Nakoda, and Tsuut''ina First Nations of Treaty 7. In the past decade, Jeremy has had the privilege of being invited to sit with and learn from Elders from many Nations. He has gained a great appreciation for Indigenous Knowledge and the importance of taking care of Mother Earth. These teachings are helping him prepare for his mission, so he was particularly honoured to learn from Treaty 7 Nations.

Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) is a joint mission with the Canadian Space Agency''s partners in the U.S. (NASA) and Europe (CNES, UKSA), containing Canadian-made technology. This sophisticated satellite will collect data on 90 per cent of Earth''s surface water – a surface we''ve barely scratched! Of course, Canada is blessed with an abundance of water, meaning this country will reap the benefits. Experts will have access to detailed data, to guide important decisions on climate change, marine habitats, shipping, flooding, spill containment, search and rescue, hydropower, fisheries, and more. We''ve selected five important regions for science and conservation to profile on our blog. Hecate Strait The southern part of the Haida Gwaii archipelago from space, with the Pacific Ocean at left, and the Hecate Strait at right. (Credit: European Union – Copernicus Program, contains modified Sentinel-1 data processed by Sentinel Hub) The strait is a shallow waterway between the archipelago of Haida Gwaii and British Columbia''s Pacific coast. It''s a busy corridor for ships, and home to an underwater oasis. The diverse marine ecosystem supports a vibrant habitat for fish species like Pacific salmon and a rare "glass sponge" reef, which formed after the last ice age and is as tall as an eight-storey building in some places. The Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound were recently designated a Marine Protected Area. Currently, a network of instruments measures ocean currents, sea levels, water temperature and salinity. Alone, their reach is limited, but when combined with SWOT''s view from space, oceanographers will get a comprehensive picture of Canada''s West Coast. Peace–Athabasca Delta The Peace–Athabasca Delta from space. (Credit: ESA) The delta formed at the convergence of two rivers and mostly falls within Canada''s largest national park, Wood Buffalo, in Alberta. It''s also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its migratory birds and wild bison. This unique ecosystem, with its wide range of conditions, from floods to droughts, has sustained Indigenous communities for centuries. The delta''s complex network lakes, rivers, and wetlands makes it the perfect playground for SWOT to show us what it can do. Given that it''s such a vast territory, it''s difficult to study the entire delta with fieldwork alone; SWOT will change this by giving hydrologists an unprecedented look at the whole area from space. North Saskatchewan River The North Saskatchewan River from space. (Credit: European Union – Copernicus Program, contains modified Sentinel-2 data processed by Sentinel Hub) The river flows from the Rockies, through the Prairies, to Hudson Bay. It is an important artery for electricity, feeding several large hydro plants, and for drinking water, as Edmonton''s sole water supply. Through the Prairies, it has a low slope, meaning it''s quite flat with little variation in elevation along the river. More than any other site, this will test the limits of the satellite, and its ability to measure the most minute changes. To ensure the most accurate measurements possible, hydrologists are setting up corresponding ground-level stations, to compare notes with SWOT''s data from space. Manicouagan Reservoir The Manicouagan Reservoir from space. (Credit: European Union – Copernicus Program, contains modified Sentinel-2 data processed by Sentinel Hub) The reservoir is a large inland lake in Quebec, clearly visible from space, formed by a meteorite impact millions of years ago. Today, it''s an important site for power generation. SWOT will help the hydro utility harness the reservoir''s full, electrifying potential! The generating stations are accessible by road, but other areas are challenging to reach, and might require a helicopter, for example. Taking water measurements at the main sites doesn''t paint the whole picture, because conditions vary across the reservoir, which is sensitive to fluctuations in wind and pressure. The satellite will measure the entire reservoir level at once, for the first time. St. Lawrence Estuary The mouth of the St. Lawrence River from space. (Credit: CSA/NASA) The estuary is one of the world''s largest, where fresh and saltwater collide, as the mighty St. Lawrence River flows into the gulf. The river is a vital shipping corridor for Canada and the United States. Researchers will use SWOT to measure tidal patterns, starting with the area between Quebec City and Rimouski. Their work will help ships navigate, contain oil spills, and protect endangered North Atlantic right whales. The St. Lawrence is very wide, and tides can vary across the river, so until now, scientists were limited to predictive models. The satellite will allow them to measure the entire waterway for the first time.

(Credit: NASA) In preparation for their 10 days in space, the Artemis II crew officially started training in June 2023. All astronauts receive basic training and, once assigned to a flight, they go through mission-specific training. Until recently, the destination for those missions was the International Space Station (ISS). We now have a new destination: the Moon! But how do you train for a mission around the Moon? The program covers everything for the crew to be successful on their journey to the Moon and back. Since it will be the very first time a crew trains for an Artemis mission, Jeremy and his crewmates will be essential in helping shape the training requirements for future flights. The training in a nutshell When it started: June 2023 Integrated simulations between the crew and Mission Control will start about 12 months before launch Where it happens: Primary location – NASA''s Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas: Orion simulator, mock-up of the crew module, rocket and spacecraft hardware Secondary location – NASA''s Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Florida: rocket and spacecraft hardware integration, and launch pad and countdown operations Other locations based on the type of training Learning to fly Orion and SLS (Space Launch System) It will be the first time that humans ride the new rocket system composed of the Orion spacecraft and the SLS, one of the most powerful rockets in the world. The crew will receive detailed lessons on Orion''s crew displays, vehicle controls and audio system. They will learn to operate and monitor systems of the spacecraft and rocket for every phase of the mission: from launch and flying to the Moon, to re-entering Earth''s atmosphere and splashdown. Here''s a summary of what they will train for: Launch and early operations prelaunch operations around the launch pad familiarization with the mobile launcher and emergency pad egress operations major milestones leading up to and during launch, as well as the first few hours in orbit abort scenarios during the ride to space rendezvous and proximity operations Flying to the Moon high Earth orbit vehicle testing to better understand Orion''s manual piloting qualities and reduce risks for future Artemis missions when Orion docks with the Lunar Gateway or lunar human landing systems execution of translunar injection and other burns to manoeuvre the spacecraft flying on a lunar trajectory solar array operations to provide power to the vehicle troubleshooting communications issues Atmosphere re-entry and splashdown overview of the entry timeline and events preparation steps taken before entry monitoring and execution of entry communications with recovery forces familiarization with different post-splashdown scenarios they could face as they await recovery on the ocean surface Spacesuit engineers show the launch arrangement for four crewmembers inside a mock-up of the Orion capsule. (Credit: NASA/Robert Markowitz) A view of the interior of the Orion spacecraft medium-fidelity mock-up used for astronaut training and systems familiarization at NASA''s Johnson Space Center in Houston. (Credit: NASA) Living aboard a new vehicle As part of their training, the crew will also refine their understanding of Orion''s systems and how to live in the equivalent of a small camper van for 10 days. This includes how to: conduct daily operations prepare food exercise using a fly wheel operate the various life support systems and habitation equipment The Artemis II crew took part in a food tasting session at NASA''s food lab at the Johnson Space Center. They tasted and rated a selection of meals and snacks ahead of their trip to the Moon. (Credit: NASA) Dealing with emergencies All space missions are risky. Lessons learned are collected after every flight to make the next ones safer and more efficient. The risks are mitigated as much as possible thanks to extensive testing of equipment and procedures on Earth and in space (think Artemis I) as well as training and preparation of both the crew and ground teams. The crew needs to train for any eventuality, learn to troubleshoot various issues that may arise, and respond to different types of emergencies and off-nominal (or abnormal, in non-space terms) scenarios such as: medical emergencies and wound care water survival emergency egress communications issues The recovery team practises for splashdown at NASA''s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on January 30, 2023. (Credit: NASA/Robert Markowitz) Getting ready for science While Orion will not be a fancy lab like the ISS, there will still be opportunities for the crew to conduct science experiments. The astronauts will also use wearable devices to monitor their health and measure radiation levels on Orion. Planet Earth''s magnetic field protects us and astronauts aboard the ISS from a lot of the space radiation. Radiation levels are a bit higher on the ISS than on Earth, but much higher outside of the magnetic field, where the crew of Artemis II will be flying. Extensive testing will be required to keep them and future Moon travellers safe. Geology training Being the "test crew," Jeremy, Reid, Victor and Christina are helping test procedures and define the training flow not only for their mission, but also for future Artemis missions. As they fly past the Moon, they will be doing some observation and photography, so having good knowledge of lunar geology will help them identify specific features of scientific interest. In May 2023, the Artemis II crewmembers participated in lunar science fundamentals training in the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facilities (aka the Lunar Lab) at NASA''s Johnson Space Center. This is where geological samples returned from the Moon by the Apollo lunar surface exploration missions (1969–1972) are preserved and studied. The crew talked to the scientists about taking photos of parts of the lunar surface that the Apollo astronauts never saw. In September 2023, Jeremy took part in field geology training with his Artemis II crewmate Christina Koch, his colleague CSA astronaut Jenni Gibbons, Dr. Gordon Osinski and a team from Western University''s Institute for Earth and Space Exploration. The expedition took place at Mistastin Lake, which covers part of a crater in Labrador formed by a meteorite impact millions of years ago. This was not Jeremy''s first time taking part in this kind of expedition, but it was his first time to a crater known to have rocks similar to those found on the Moon. Three astronauts wearing clean room suits are seen through the glass of a vault containing lunar rock samples.

Two days later, the vehicle will dock to the International Space Station autonomously, in order to deliver vital supplies to the crew. Dragon will transport a variety of science equipment, including materials required for Canadian experiment CARDIOBREATH, which tracks changes in how astronauts'' cardiovascular and respiratory systems control their blood pressure. Dragon will also carry five Canadian CubeSat Project CubeSats, designed and built by Canadian students: Ukpik-1: Western University, Ontario SC-ODIN: Concordia University, Quebec Iris: University of Manitoba, Manitoba RADSAT-SK: University of Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan ESSENCE: York University, Ontario These miniature satellites will soon be deployed into space. In addition, Dragon will be delivering two iROSA solar panels, which provide much more energy than traditional solar panels while also being significantly lighter. The panels will be removed from the trunk with the assistance of Canadarm2 and Dextre, then installed during two spacewalks. Canadarm2 will lend the astronauts a helping hand during those spacewalks. As capcom, Canadian Space Agency astronaut Jenni Gibbons will play an essential role while the two iROSA panels are being installed. She will ensure communications between Mission Control Center on Earth and the astronauts in space. Live coverage of Dragon''s launch will begin on NASA TV on June 3, starting at 12:34 pm ET.

Play Mute Volume Current position:00:00:00 Total time:--:--:-- Show closed captioning Enter full screen Everything you always wanted to know about CubeSats. (Credits: Canadian Space Agency, NASA, University of Alberta) Among them, the Dalhousie University team successfully deployed their CubeSat (LORIS) from the International Space Station (ISS) in December 2022. LORIS is now operational and will soon start its scientific mission. Written in the stars: Arad Gharagozli''s journey Arad Gharagozli has been an active, prominent member of the Dalhousie University team from the beginning. He came to see the CCP not only as a student project but also from a start-up angle. Arad Gharagozli. (Credits: Arad Gharagozli, Dalhousie University) As per Arad''s own words: taking part in the CCP confirmed he wanted to build a career for himself in the space sector. "CCP enabled myself and so many others to experience something that otherwise would be almost impossible to materialize; it was the boost that we needed to actually bring ideas into reality in the world of space innovation, which is challenging to navigate both technologically and financially. Without CCP, many of these ideas would have remained just that – an idea – and most students would have ended up in other industries. One the most important aspects of CCP is the community it created. An ecosystem of incredibly talented and motivated professionals and experts, both from industry and academia, came together to work on something they all deeply love, and that is space exploration. When you have such a powerful community, anything is possible, and I''m very much excited about the future of our space industry because of it." The results now speak for themselves: by bringing the expertise and talent of the CubeSat team to local businesses, Arad has helped build a growing space sector in Canada''s Maritime provinces. He has found the inspiration and energy to develop initiatives that have become a must for Maritime youth interested in all things space-related. The CCP was also a determining factor in Arad''s decision to found GALAXIA Mission Systems Inc. (GALAXIA), a small company that is already positioning itself as a key player of the space industry in the Maritimes. A bright future ahead The CSA recently awarded a $1.7 million contribution to GALAXIA to carry a demonstration for its Möbius Constellation. This satellite constellation, the first software-defined Earth observation (EO) platform will host an array of powerful and versatile space sensors on a shared-access basis. GALAXIA aims to make space more accessible and affordable for SMEs. Its new EO solution could help businesses of any size to enter the space sector, with applications in industries such as environment and agriculture monitoring, maritime activities, infrastructure management and transportation. "Our mission is to solve problems on Earth from space by developing the most advanced, efficient, and powerful space computation systems in the world. We are bringing a sophisticated ecosystem of modern computation to space and putting it into the hands of small-to-medium sized businesses who have traditionally faced significant barriers to access. We have established our first flight heritage, and this is only the beginning. We are proud to represent Canada on this global race and lead this segment of our industry for years to come." The CSA''s financial support for the development of this technology was allocated through its Space Technology Development Program.

(Credit: RADARSAT Constellation Mission imagery © Government of Canada [2023]. RADARSAT is an official mark of the Canadian Space Agency) The RCM is the most recent mission in the RADARSAT program, which began in 1995 with the launch of RADARSAT-1. RADARSAT satellites are equipped with powerful synthetic aperture radars that transmit and receive microwaves to produce high-quality images of Earth. They have the advantage of being able to scan Earth day and night and in all weather conditions, in addition to being particularly efficient in monitoring water and soil moisture. Canada has developed world-renowned expertise in radar technology. RCM data is used by more than ten federal departments to provide services to Canadians in areas such as maritime surveillance, disaster management and ecosystem monitoring. To illustrate the many ways in which this benefits our lives, here are a few colourized images from the RCM. Floods Image produced using data from the RCM shows the areas flooded by the Red River Flood in May 2022. Turquoise squares show agricultural fields and pink squares show flooding areas. (Credit: RADARSAT Constellation Mission imagery © Government of Canada [2022]. RADARSAT is an official mark of the Canadian Space Agency. Data processed by Dromadaire Géo-Innovations) This image produced using data from the RCM shows the areas flooded by the Red River Flood in May 2022. It shows the area surrounding the town of Morris, Manitoba, which was particularly affected by the flooding. The Red River runs from south to north. It serves as the border between North Dakota and Minnesota in the United States, all the way up to Manitoba in Canada. It has been subject to recurring floods. The situation became concerning in spring 2022, both in the United States and Canada, because of late snowfalls and a quick thaw. RCM data is used by public safety officials to facilitate flood predictions, response activities in affected areas and restoration of those areas. Agriculture Image produced using data from the RCM that shows an agricultural area in Alberta. The different types of crops are in shades of yellow and brown, while forests and wetlands are in green and purple. (Credit: RADARSAT Constellation Mission imagery © Government of Canada [2021]. RADARSAT is an official mark of the Canadian Space Agency. Data processed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) Understanding the state and trends in agricultural production is essential to combat threats to agricultural production and to ensure profitability in the sector. The Earth Observation Team of the Science and Technology Branch at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada began the process of generating annual crop inventory digital maps, namely by using RCM data. This image shows an agricultural area in Alberta, its different types of crops (shades of yellow and brown), which are distinct from the forests and wetlands. Satellite imagery can be used to estimate the condition of crops and to determine the amount of cropland and the type of crop (e.g. wheat, barley, soybean) as well as the volume that will be produced, for example. Farmers and agronomists use these maps to assess soil and crop properties, and to inform their actions to optimize crop yield and farm sustainability. Ice Satellite image produced using data from the RCM that shows the Mackenzie River, in the Northwest Territories. Each colour in the image represents the different states of water. (Credit: RADARSAT Constellation Mission imagery © Government of Canada [2021]. RADARSAT is an official mark of the Canadian Space Agency. Data processed by Natural Resources Canada) This image of the Mackenzie River, in the Northwest Territories, taken on June 1, 2021, shows the presence of ice. Open water is illustrated in blue; smooth ice is in green. Orange, red and pink represent consolidated ice varying from rough to very rough. Ice jams are formed in the red and pink sections of the river. Natural Resources Canada''s Emergency Geomatics Service uses satellite imagery to actively monitor ice break-up and flooding in the spring to generate maps showing ice conditions and flooded areas to support emergency response operations across Canada. RCM data helps ensure safe and efficient navigation through sea ice by providing information on ice quality, density and resistance as well as on the ice formation cycle. It supports the commercial maritime sector in Canada. Biodiversity and wetlands Satellite image that shows La Mauricie National Park in Quebec, Canada. A river and many lakes are in black, coniferous forests are in green and the deciduous forests are in beige. A town is located along the river, towards the bottom.

Landsat 8 image courtesy of the U.S. Geological Survey. Contains modified data from the Sentinel-1 mission from ESA''s Copernicus initiative) La Mauricie National Park is located on the edge of the Canadian Shield, which is characterized here by rounded terrain and dotted with numerous lakes. This product is composed of three images. The colours from the Landsat image in the visible spectrum acquired on May 9, 2022, were combined with two radar images, one from the RCM captured on May 6, 2022, and another from Sentinel-1 taken on November 30, 2021. The result makes it easier to discern the contours of the terrain features. Because it is spring and leaves are beginning to grow, it is possible to differentiate coniferous forests (in green) from deciduous forests (light brown). There are also hundreds of lakes in black. Radar technology is particularly useful for monitoring lakes and wetlands. Wetlands have many benefits, including absorbing the impact of large waves or floods; filtering residues and toxic elements; supplying food and vital habitat for many wildlife species; and providing us with sources of food, energy and materials. In order to conserve and carefully use the resources available in wetlands, it is necessary to map and classify them. The RCM provides data to the Canadian Wetland Inventory.

The Government of Canada relies on Earth observation (EO) data to deliver many services to Canadians, including shore erosion and ice monitoring, flood warning and ship detection. Canada has unique EO needs due to its vast territory and remote locations. The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is Canada''s latest generation of EO satellites. The three identical satellites work together to provide daily images of Canada''s land and maritime approaches, as well as images of the Arctic. This imagery is essential for many applications, such as monitoring the environment and the North, supporting emergency response teams and making marine travel safer. The Earth Observation Service Continuity (EOSC) initiative is looking at ways to ensure continuous access to satellite radar EO imagery beyond the lifetime of the RCM. The RADARSAT legacy For more than 25 years, images from RADARSAT-1, RADARSAT-2 and the RCM have been of enormous value to the Government of Canada. The RADARSAT satellites are equipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), a powerful microwave instrument that transmits and receives signals to capture high-quality images of Earth. A unique benefit of this technology is its ability to image night and day, and in all weather conditions. New innovative solutions for EO Text version Infographic presenting the four sources of data being considered under the Earth Observation Service Continuity initiative. (Credits: Canadian Space Agency, satellite images: Dromadaire Géo-Innovations/KorrAI Technologies using RADARSAT Constellation Mission imagery © Government of Canada (2021). RADARSAT is an official mark of the Canadian Space Agency) Since the launch of the RCM in 2019, technology has progressed and EO needs have evolved. This is why through the EOSC initiative, we are reassessing these needs and exploring the emerging technologies that can help meet them. After three successful generations of RADARSAT, the next generation of satellite assets and supporting infrastructure could look different. The Government of Canada is exploring all available options to provide ongoing data access so that there is no break in the provision of essential services to Canadians. We are exploring: access to free and open data purchase of commercial data collaboration with international partners construction and use of government-owned sensors and satellites Consultations with other federal government departments As part of its mandate, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) helps other federal government departments meet their satellite EO needs. The CSA consults with key users to understand and identify their future needs in order to guide the definition and implementation of cost-effective solutions. Natural Resources Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Department of National Defence, among others, are actively collaborating in this process. Development of innovative solutions and concepts Since 2020, eight companies have received funding to develop and propose concept solutions for the EOSC. After all eight companies submitted their initial analysis, the CSA provided additional funding to four of them – MDA, Airbus, C-Core and Alpha Insight – to further develop their concepts. The Government of Canada continues to explore the most promising technological ideas. In fall 2022, the CSA issued a Request for Proposals, inviting industry to propose technology R&D projects in support of future radar EO projects, like the EOSC. This request focuses on assessing the feasibility and risks of key enabling technologies that might be required for future projects. Ten contracts were awarded under the CSA''s Space Technology and Development Program (STDP) to five companies: AstroCom, Calian, C-CORE, EarthDaily Analytics and MDA. Open data In line with the spirit of open government and global trends, the CSA is aiming to make its EO data available to the broadest extent possible. The goal is to help: advance science and knowledge in a variety of domains, including climate change foster innovation and fuel Canada''s digital economy broaden and strengthen the Canadian and international EO communities Public and government users can access satellite images and data products through the Earth Observation Data Management System (EODMS), managed by Natural Resources Canada.

"It was a great experience … to move a rover. It was pretty cool." Inspiring young Canadians like Mia to reach for the stars and to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) is a priority of Canada''s Space Strategy. In 2022, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) ramped up its STEM outreach efforts in a big way. To connect youth to real space challenges, we launched the Space Brain Hack, an annual initiative running from October to February to get youth in grades 6 to 12 thinking about solutions to open-ended problems and questions related to the Lunar Gateway and other space missions. The theme this year: mental health and isolation. CSA astronaut Joshua Kutryk brainstormed ideas with students at the launch of the Space Brain Hack in Vancouver, British Columbia, in October 2022. (Credit: CSA) We also committed over $3.5 million through grants, contributions and contracts for the development and delivery of multi-year space STEM activities designed for K–12 youth and educators across the country. These hands-on projects relate to robotics and artificial intelligence, lunar science and rovers, health and nutrition, and Moon missions. Through these activities and a variety of events, we engaged over 25,000 educators and young Canadians across the country, especially kids underrepresented in STEM, and connected them to experts. One of the funded projects is the Lunar Rover Research Challenge, in which Mia participated. It is a national space competition for youth in grades 6 to 9 offered by Let''s Talk Science, Canadensys Aerospace Corporation and Avalon Space. It allows students to collaborate and develop a mission for lunar exploration. Over 3,500 young people from across Canada participated in the first edition of the challenge in fall 2022. Students from London, Penetanguishene, Lacombe, and Niagara Falls won the opportunity this past December to virtually control a Canadensys lunar rover in a Moon-like environment, allowing them to interact with technology that will be part of Canada''s upcoming rover mission. They completed a mission simulation by taking different roles and working as a team to drive the rover and seek out ice deposits in a mock lunar landscape. "The Earthlings" (foreground) is one of four winning groups of the first edition of the Lunar Rover Research Challenge. Their whole class at Burkevale Protestant School in Penetanguishene, Ontario, got to do a mission simulation and drive a rover in December 2022. (Credit: Austin Vavrovics, Grade 6 teacher at Burkevale Protestant School) Emma Christie, Grade 6 educator in Niagara Falls, Ontario, said this about the challenge: "My students were actively engaged in the project from start to finish. I overheard many great conversations between students that involved critical thinking, problem solving and reflection." Activities like this one also encourage youth to consider all the opportunities available in space exploration and STEM careers. We want them to see how they could play a role in Canada''s missions to the Moon, and beyond. Registration for the spring session of the Lunar Rover Research Challenge opened in January, and a third edition will run in the fall. The CSA is also working on other exciting learning opportunities with partners for 2023 and beyond. Stay tuned! What educators had to say about the Lunar Rover Research Challenge "It is always nice to find something to get passionate about, and this had me really excited (and still does)." Andrew Bell, Grade 5 and 7 educator, London, Ontario "Students were really interested to understand the Canadian role in Artemis. I think it was inspiring to read about Canadian scientists and companies who have a big role in space exploration and study. This project opened their minds to understanding how space exploration relates to problems here on Earth. We had lots of good discussions about science and ethics." Kyla Smith, Grade 7-8-9 educator, Arrowwood, Alberta "This project highlighted the contributions of Canada to space exploration, which is closely linked with our curriculum. […] It also showed students the future of space exploration, and how we are working together to explore the Moon and beyond. It helped them see the value of space exploration by looking at the technologies that they use daily that are direct developments of the space programs of the past."

It is a driver of economic growth, a catalyst for invention, a creator of transformational technologies, and a source of essential information. The space sector is becoming more competitive as technology rapidly proliferates and more players enter the global space market with innovative technologies and transformative applications (e.g. satellite constellations; space resource utilization; in-space servicing, assembly and manufacturing). In order to ensure that Canadian industry is equipped with a modern regulatory framework for space that will enable it to compete in this global market, the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) is working with government partners to conduct a review of Canada''s regulatory framework for space-related activities. This review, a commitment in the Government of Canada''s space strategy (Exploration, Imagination, Innovation: A New Space Strategy for Canada), will help to make sure that Canada''s space-related regulations are keeping pace with the changes in the global space sector so that we enable innovative space companies to prosper here in Canada while respecting national security considerations and international obligations. From January 31 to April 4, 2023, Canadians were invited to share their views on Canada''s space regulatory framework. The consultation period closed on April 4, 2023. The What We Heard report provides an overview of the key themes of the responses received. Consultation process From January 31 to April 4, 2023, the Government of Canada sought views from Canadians on Canada''s space regulatory framework. The consultation process was open to all Canadians; everyone was invited to share their perspectives. In particular, stakeholders with an interest in the Canadian space regulatory environment were invited to provide feedback. Interested parties may include: Canadian businesses, especially those who are affected by Canadian space regulations or who are engaged in emerging space activities or space launch Academics and experts, including specialists in space law, space regulation, and emerging space activities Non-governmental organizations Other individuals or groups Suggested questions Participants were asked to consider reviewing the background context and answering the following questions as they prepared their submissions: How do you view the current regulatory framework for space and how does it affect your organization? If the Government of Canada were to modify the regulatory framework for space, what should the goals of that framework be and why? What issues or activities require a new or changed approach and why? What does the Government need to know to ensure that a modern regulatory framework enables space companies to prosper in Canada? The consultation period closed at 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on April 4, 2023. Backgrounder text In 2019 the Government of Canada released Exploration, Imagination, Innovation: A New Space Strategy for Canada. In order to deliver on the vision for Canada''s space strategy, the Government committed to reviewing Canada''s regulatory framework for space-related activities. Consultations with Canadians will provide stakeholders the opportunity to weigh in on this important work. You are invited to consult the background materials below before submitting your views. Canadian expertise and leadership in space Canada has long been a major player in space. In 1962, Canada became the third country to independently build and operate a satellite with the launch of Alouette 1. Canada''s astronaut corps was formed in 1983, and has since included fourteen astronauts. Canada is a partner on the International Space Station (ISS) and on the upcoming U.S.-led Lunar Gateway, and is involved in a number of exciting space exploration initiatives that will help humanity take the next steps to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. A Canadian astronaut will be a part of Artemis II, the first crewed mission to the Moon since 1972. Canadian space sector The Canadian space sector has established a world-class reputation in many areas, including in Earth observation (EO), space robotics, space science and exploration, and satellite communications. In 2019 alone, the sector is estimated to have contributed $2.5B to Canada''s GDP and supported a total of 22,879 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs in the greater Canadian economy (including space sector jobs, supply industry jobs and jobs created as a result of consumer spending). Canadian space organizations are internationally renowned for their leading-edge technologies. Earth observation Canada launched RADARSAT-1 in 1995, followed by RADARSAT-2 in 2007 and the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) in 2019 to bring solutions to key challenges for Canadians. SCISAT, an atmospheric research satellite launched in 2003, provides data on the ozone layer as well as climate change and air quality and pollution. Canada''s latest EO satellite missions are in development. Wildfiresat has a planned launch date in 2029. It will monitor all active wildfires in Canada on a daily basis. The HAWC mission, a major component of NASA''s Earth System Observatory, will launch in 2031. It will provide critical data to support extreme weather prediction, climate modelling, and monitoring of disasters. In addition to domestic capability, Canada also partners with other countries to build EO satellites (e.g. NASA''s Cloudsat) and share data (e.g. with the European Copernicus program). Satellite EO is estimated to make an annual contribution of $20.7 billion in productivity improvements to the Canadian economy, an impressive number that illustrates the importance of satellite EO data to society. In 2022, the Government of Canada released Resourceful, Resilient, Ready: Canada''s Strategy for Satellite Earth Observation. The Strategy will guide efforts to generate the skills and economic opportunities needed to take advantage of new and emerging EO capabilities, and will also inform the GC''s investment in new technologies such as machine learning, big data analytics, and advanced satellite systems. Robotics Canada is a world leader in space robotics. The legendary Canadarm was first deployed in space in 1981 on NASA''s space shuttle Columbia. Canadarm2 (2001) and Dextre (2008) were later installed on the ISS and have been instrumental in the assembly, maintenance and continuous operations of the Station. Looking ahead, Canada will contribute Canadarm3 to the U.S.-led Gateway, a lunar outpost that will enable sustainable human exploration of the Moon and a cornerstone of NASA''s Artemis Program. Canada''s expertise in space robotics has had important spin-off benefits on Earth. The neuroArm for example, is an image-guided robotic system used to assist neurosurgeons. The technology that went into developing neuroArm was born of the Canadarm, Canadarm2 and Dextre. Space science and exploration Canada has been a major contributor to space science and exploration innovations and discoveries. Examples include important science contributions to the ISS, the OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission, and the James Webb Space Telescope. Canada is committed to participating in international space exploration efforts that aim to extend humanity''s reach further into the solar system. Canada is a partner in the next major human exploration and science mission, the U.S.-led Lunar Gateway, which is a cornerstone of NASA''s Artemis Program, a multi-mission campaign that will push human space exploration to the Moon and on to Mars. To support its lunar exploration activities, the CSA created the Lunar Exploration Accelerator Program (or "LEAP") , which provides a wide range of opportunities for Canadian space science and technology activities in lunar orbit, on the Moon''s surface, and beyond. The program fosters innovations in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, science and health, and supports the commercialization of innovative ideas from Canadian industry. Canada''s space legal framework Aeronautics Act (Transport Canada) - The Aeronautics Act (AA) enables the making of regulations respecting the conditions under which aircraft may be used and operated or under which any act may be performed in or from an aircraft. The AA further authorizes the making of regulations respecting activities at aerodromes and the location, inspection, certification, registration, licensing and operation of aerodromes. The AA also applies to rockets and aerodromes used for the purposes of commercial space launch. Currently, pursuant to the Aeronautics Act and the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs), no one can launch a rocket from Canada without having obtained authorization from the Minister of Transport. Radiocommunication Act (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada) - The Radiocommunication Act is Canada''s framework legislation for the management of radiocommunication transmission facilities and radio apparatus. Remote Sensing Space Systems Act (RSSSA) (Global Affairs Canada) – The RSSSA regulates remote sensing space systems operated by Canadians, which includes remote sensing satellites and their data and ground segments. A remote sensing satellite is defined under the RSSSA as one that is "capable of sensing the surface of the Earth through the use of electromagnetic waves." To regulate the operation of these remote sensing space systems, Global Affairs Canada (GAC) ensures, through licensing, that remote sensing activities are not injurious to national security, to the defence of Canada, to the safety of Canadian Armed Forces or to Canada''s conduct of international relations nor are they inconsistent with Canada''s international obligations. Canadian Space Agency Act (Canadian Space Agency) – The CSA has a broad mandate to promote the peaceful use and development of space, to advance the knowledge of space through science and to ensure that space science and technology provide social and economic benefits for Canadians. As part of this role, the CSA coordinates and develops the Government of Canada''s space policies and programs. The CSA handles all matters concerning space that are not specifically assigned to any other department or agency of the Government of Canada. Other statutes, such as the Export and Import Permits Act, have an impact on space sector activities. International treaties Canada is a party to a series of treaties established through the United Nations in the 1960s and 1970s that form the basis of the legal framework for Canada on how to conduct activities in outer space: Outer Space Treaty: The Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies (Outer Space Treaty) of 1967 sets out principles, rights and obligations for state parties in the progress of their exploration and use of outer space, recognizing the common interest of all humankind. It also provides the foundation from which other space treaties were developed. Canada is one of the 112 states party to the treaty. Rescue Agreement: The Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Rescue Agreement) of 1968 sets out state parties'' responsibilities in respect of the return of astronauts and space objects in the event of accident, distress or emergency landing. Canada is one of the 99 states party to the treaty. Liability Convention: The Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects (Liability Convention) of 1972 sets out rules concerning liability in relation to damage caused by space objects. Canada is one of the 98 states party to the treaty. Registration Convention: The Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space (Registration Convention) of 1976 requires states party to establish and maintain a national registry of space objects and to register national space objects with the United Nations. Canada is one of the 72 states party to the treaty.

Following a full investigation by NASA and Canadian Space Agency teams, the cause was determined to likely be a galactic cosmic ray, a form of high-energy radiation from outside our solar system that can sometimes disrupt electrical systems. Encountering cosmic rays is a normal and expected part of operating any spacecraft. Webb engineers determined that rebooting the instrument would bring it back to full functionality. After completing the reboot, NIRISS telemetry data demonstrated normal timing, and to fully confirm, the team scheduled a test observation.

(Credit: CNES/Mira Productions) On December 16, 2022, NASA launched the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, a collaboration with France''s space agency Centre national d''études spatiales (CNES) that also includes the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the United Kingdom Space Agency. SWOT will survey 90 percent of Earth''s surface water. The mission has major implications for scientists working to better understand the dynamics of the world''s oceans, rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Data from SWOT will help researchers address important global issues like climate change and Canada''s management of water. Here are six things to know about the fascinating science behind SWOT. SWOT will vastly expand what we know about the ocean''s surface Artist''s rendering of the SWOT satellite collecting precise water measurements. (Credit: CSA) The ocean''s surface is a rich source of information that scientists can use to better understand weather, climate, ecosystems and life all over the world. For many years, satellites and ocean buoys have given scientists at Fisheries and Oceans Canada data about marine winds, ocean waves, sea ice, and contaminants such as oil pollution and dirty bilge water. With the SWOT launch, wide avenues of inquiry are opening as huge new data sets become available to complement data from older satellites. SWOT will take measurements over 120-km-wide swaths of area. When stitched together, these swaths will provide researchers with exponentially more information than before about the ocean''s surface, including new information about major features such as the Labrador Current and the Gulf Stream. These rich data sets will help scientists improve ocean current forecasting and marine weather prediction in sensitive coastal areas, as the new data is assimilated into existing forecast models. More than that, SWOT mission data will ultimately help scientists better understand longer-term weather patterns and predict with more confidence the climate change scenarios that are an inevitable part of our future. SWOT data will help scientists protect whales and other species North Atlantic right whale in Canadian waters. SWOT data will also help build more sophisticated models for ecosystems, and learn more about how physical oceanography influences fisheries and various biological species. As one example, SWOT will contribute to a project to protect North Atlantic right whales in Canadian waters, says William Perrie, a research scientist with Fisheries and Oceans Canada. By tracking the Gaspé Current in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, researchers can determine where zooplankton are possibly found and, therefore, where right whales might gather to feed. This crucial information could help protect whales against vessel collisions and fishing gear entanglements in our waters. SWOT scientists will transform modelling for water resource management Text version The SWOT mission - surveying Earth''s surface water to help adapt to climate change and improve water management - infographic Infographic presenting elements to be studied by Canadian scientists with SWOT mission data. (Credit: CSA) At Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), SWOT data will enable scientists to carry out a Canada-wide water balance that will give them key information about lake levels across the country, says Daniel Peters, a research scientist with ECCC. And at Université de Sherbrooke, which works closely with ECCC, researchers such as Mélanie Trudel are developing new approaches to integrate future SWOT data into existing water resource management models. Lake level, river slope and river discharge data, when added to hydrological models, will yield a much more accurate picture, says Trudel. More accurate water discharge forecasts are useful for organizations such as Hydro-Québec or provincial governments, which need to know where water is (and will be) distributed among the lakes and rivers of a watershed. Researchers will also integrate SWOT data that is spatially distributed into water-balance models, which examine a reservoir or lake and calculate the rate at which water flows out. These models are used by dam managers to optimize such things as hydropower production, and to reduce the effects of flooding. Developing sound modelling and accurate water-balance forecasts will be increasingly important in the context of climate change. SWOT will help scientists predict major changes in water flows and, as a result, protect communities and infrastructure. With climate change, it will be more difficult for water resource managers to optimize hydropower production as heavy rains, storms, winter flooding and drought become harder to predict. SWOT will help unravel the mysteries of northern lakes Canada''s lakes account for 62% of all lakes in the world (in blue). (Credit: HydroLAKES) Hydrologists who are working in Canada''s Arctic, such as Wilfrid Laurier University''s Philip Marsh, will use SWOT data to study shallow thermokarst lakes from north of Inuvik to the Beaufort Sea. This area has some of the highest concentrations of lakes not just in Canada, but anywhere in the world. The tens of thousands of lakes in this region are important as habitats to waterfowl, fish and other species, and also important for hunting, trapping, fishing and recreation for northern communities, says Marsh. SWOT will for the first time provide accurate data on the water surface elevation of lakes across the Arctic. This will significantly improve understanding of all aspects of Arctic water. As one example, SWOT will capture a phenomenon known as "catastrophic lake drainage" where an entire lake, often up to 2 km across, can completely drain in a single day. Lake drainage is a natural event. However, it is believed that warm temperatures resulting from climate change create conditions that enhance melting of permafrost ice that surrounds the banks of these lakes, and therefore increases the number of lakes draining each year. As entire lakes drain, the water flows downstream through the existing stream network, but in some cases creates new stream channels. Lake drainage results in major floods, impacting habitats, and creating hazards to stream users and cabins. Eventually it converts lake habitat to tundra habitat. Until now, hydrologists have witnessed very few catastrophic drainage events. SWOT data will enable them to witness the phenomenon in near real time for many lakes each year. This will help scientists determine if the number of draining events is increasing as the climate warms and permafrost ice thaws, and what effects we will likely see across the Arctic under various future climate change scenarios. Why should we care about these remote lakes draining? The total area of thermokarst lakes across the Arctic is roughly the size of the Greenland ice sheet and is almost as large as the Amazon rainforest. As temperatures continue to rise in the Arctic, it is conceivable that all such lakes could completely drain in the future, with dramatic impacts on people, ecosystems and climate of the Arctic. SWOT will undergo a period of validation to ensure accurate operations During the calibration and validation phase, Canadian scientists will validate the data coming from SWOT to ensure its measurements are accurate. (Credit: Mélanie Trudel) During the three months after SWOT''s launch, engineers will adjust its orbit and ensure its systems are working properly. Next, Canadian scientists will participate in a three-month calibration and validation phase where instruments on Earth will validate the data coming from SWOT to ensure its measurements are accurate. During validation, SWOT will follow a one-day repeat orbit instead of the 21-day orbit the satellite will follow during regular operations. This orbit will yield rich data for the area it covers, which in Canada includes the Pacific coast, the Peace-Athabasca Delta, multiple Prairie lakes, the St. Lawrence River, the Atlantic coast and many more, says CSA Mission Scientist Jean Bergeron, who is also a hydrologist. SWOT relies on a vital Canadian innovation The CSA provided a set of extended interaction klystrons (EIKs) – a key component of NASA''s radar instrument. (Credit: Communications & Power Industries Canada Inc.) The CSA has provided a key component of SWOT''s Ka-band radar interferometer (KaRIn), the instrument that NASA will use to gather data from the surfaces of lakes, oceans and other bodies of water and calculate their elevation. KaRIn emits light in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum and then measures the light reflected by Earth''s surface that returns to SWOT. But this instrument works only if KaRIn''s radar signals are amplified as high-power pulses. From its Ontario facility, Communications & Power Industries Canada Inc. has provided this key technology, called extended interaction klystron technology, to enable this process.

(Credit: X-ray: JAXA/Optical: DSS*** ) ***The Digitized Sky Survey Figure 2 is an X-ray image of the supernova remnant SN 1006 taken by XRISM''s onboard soft X-ray imager (Xtend). This object is the remnant of a supernova (*2) that exploded in 1006 AD. SN 1006 has expanded into a large spherical object 65 light-years in diameter over the 1,000 years since its explosion and is still expanding at 5,000 kilometers per second. Thanks to Xtend''s wide field of view, SN 1006, with an apparent visual diameter of about 30 arcminutes (about the same size as the full moon), could fit entirely within the image taken. This data will allow a detailed study of the abundance of elements created by the fusion reaction during the explosion, as well as the expansion of the remnant. Early science data is now accessible on the XRISM researchers’ website (*3). This resource aims to support researchers globally in crafting precise observation proposals by offering insights into XRISM''s performance. Stay tuned to our website for future updates on observation outcomes. < Comments by MAEJIMA Hironori, XRISM Project Manager> Following the successful completion of the initial functional verification for the satellite and ground systems, we have officially commenced nominal scientific observations. Our inaugural observations have revealed impressive performance, marking an auspicious beginning. Equipped with XRISM, an international X-ray observatory, we remain steadfast in our mission to unravel the mysteries of the Universe through continued exploration of celestial phenomena. < Comments by TASHIRO Makoto, XRISM Principal Investigator> At long last, scientific observations have commenced. The XRISM team will meticulously conduct in-orbit calibrations and disseminate scientific findings through performance verification observations. Following this, in approximately August, we will initiate observations based on proposals submitted by global researchers. We eagerly look forward to the opportunity of serving as an open observatory, contributing to scientific advancements. *1: A galaxy cluster, the most expansive entity in the cosmos, comprises numerous galaxies spanning 10 million light-years in diameter. Galaxies are drawn together by the gravitational force exerted by a mysterious substance known as "dark matter." This gravitational pull attracts galaxies and draws in hydrogen gas formed in the universe''s early stages. This drawn-in hydrogen gas transforms into ultra-hot plasma, reaching tens of millions of degrees Kelvin and emitting vibrant X-ray radiation. *2: A supernova is an astronomical event characterized by a sudden, intense burst of luminosity resulting from a massive explosion originating from either a massive star or a white dwarf. SN 1006 is thought to have resulted from a significant eruption of a white dwarf. A white dwarf is a dense remnant left behind after the death of a Sun-like star. When a white dwarf forms a binary system with another star, the gravitational pull causes material from the companion star to accrete onto the white dwarf. This process triggers a runaway nuclear fusion reaction within the white dwarf, leading to a catastrophic explosion of the entire system. *3: https://xrism.isas.jaxa.jp/research/proposer/erd/index.html Related Links XRISM Special Site XRISM project website XRISM official XExternal Link'),

MetCom, Inc. (Representative Director: HIRASAWA Hiroki; hereinafter, “MetCom”) *2 and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (President: YAMAKAWA Hiroshi; hereinafter, “JAXA”) have embarked on co-creation activities related to terrestrial PNT(Positioning, Navigation and Timing) system under the framework of JAXA Space Innovation through Partnership and Co-creation (J-SPARC) *3, a program that aims to create space-related businesses based on unconventional approaches. The co-creation project aims to improve the accuracy of time synchronization between base stations, a key contributor to accurate terrestrial PNT, by two orders of magnitude. Specifically, the time synchronization information gained through Multi-GNSS Advanced Orbit and Clock Augmentation - Precise Point Positioning (MADOCA-PPP) *4 utilizing centimeter-level positioning augmentation signals, will be incorporated into the Metropolitan Beacon System (MBS), MetCom’s planned 3D PNT service that will allow the provision of seamless location information in urban areas, whether underground, indoors or outdoors. In addition, by integrating JAXA’s array antenna technology*5 under development into the satellite signal receiving antenna at ground base stations to be constructed by MetCom, interference resistance and security will be enhanced. The co-creation project aims to provide seamless, highly precise and secure 3D location information indoors and outdoors, from basement to high-rise floors. [Background to the co-creation activities] Due to the development of satellite positioning systems including the U.S. global positioning system (GPS) and Japan’s Quasi-Zenith Satellite System “Michibiki” (QZSS), the utilization of location information has become an integral part of our daily lives. However, it has been a major premise that location information is for outdoor use. A range of ideas have been proposed to break the premise, but no service that can provide seamless indoor/outdoor positioning at a feasible cost and accuracy has emerged yet. The MBS 3D PNT service planned to be offered by MetCom aims to seamlessly provide location information whether underground, indoors or outdoors, breaking the presupposed notion that location information is for outdoor use. Transmitting positioning signals from proprietary ground base stations enables the signals to be carried by radio waves that ensure a significantly higher reception strength than satellite ranging signals, allowing them to reach underground and indoor locations. Moreover, the time distribution service also under plan by MetCom aims to deliver time information on radio waves featuring a far higher reception strength than satellite signals, thereby enhancing resistance to radio interference. Anticipated use cases of the time distribution service include highly stable and reliable time synchronization for mission-critical operations such as telecommunication systems, financial networks, data centers, and power grid networks. [Details of the co-creation activities] MetCom will incorporate time information based on MADOCA-PPP into the time synchronization process of the MBS 3D PNT system. Compared with using only GPS for time synchronization, the adoption of MADOCA-PPP-based time information is expected to enhance the positioning accuracy between base stations by two digits, narrowing down the distance error from several meters to several centimeters. Furthermore, MetCom will examine the effectiveness of adopting JAXA’s array antenna technology currently under development into the satellite signal receiving antenna for the ground base stations that it plans to construct, and provide JAXA with feedback to help its development of the technology. JAXA will conduct R&D on time synchronization technology using MADOCA-PPP and on array antenna technology. Specifically, JAXA will develop and test a 1 pulse per second (PPS) calibration device, and add a high-precision time synchronization function to its precise point positioning software (MALIB) currently under development, with the aim of opening up new applications for the MADOCA-PPP service. In addition, JAXA will conduct R&D on enhancing interference resistance by replacing satellite signal receiving antennas at ground base stations into the developing array antennas. Positioning signals transmitted from satellites travel long distances, weakening in strength when received. This makes them susceptible to jamming and spoofing. By using array antennas to increase directivity and allowing them to preferentially receive positioning signals from QZSS, JAXA aims to enhance resistance to jamming and spoofing, thereby improving security, safety and reliability. In the first couple of years of the co-creation initiative, MetCom and JAXA will independently conduct R&D, running a feedback loop for incorporating the outcomes into the MBS 3D PNT system. Subsequently, the two parties will aim to achieve a highly accurate and secure and safe terrestrial PNT system that incorporates their respective technologies. [The future we envision] If the co-creation initiative successfully provides highly accurate, safe and seamless location information whether underground, indoors or outdoors, it may provide a range of solutions, such as monitoring the location of children or the elderly within buildings or on basement floors, pinpointing the location of firefighters unable to move during rescue operations in a building fire following the loss of radio communication, and finding the location of a lost in-flight drone or air mobility. In addition, the service will provide a backup means for existing satellite positioning systems, ensuring that users can always obtain location information essential in everyday life. Through the co-creation, JAXA and MetCom will seek to achieve a society where reliable positioning services unbound by time or place can be taken for granted. [To protect our country and society] The satellite PNT system is essential for the stable operation of social infrastructure such as transportation, power grids, and communication infrastructure. There have recently been numerous incidents worldwide that make it difficult or impossible to use the system, including jamming and spoofing. Amid such increasingly apparent threat, the world is becoming more aware of the necessity of PNT systems to complement satellite positioning service. In the US, European Union (EU) and UK, complementary PNT initiatives are underway by the governments. Given such circumstances, the collaboration between JAXA and MetCom, which combines the Japanese government’s QZSS and MetCom’s MBS terrestrial PNT system, can also be deemed as a pursuit to establish a complementary PNT system that can be controlled and operated in Japan. The new initiative also has profound significance in this respect. *1 PNT "PNT" stands for "Positioning, Navigation and Timing." It refers to systems and technologies that provide information about the positioning (location) and navigation (direction and movement) of objects or individuals, and timing (time). One common example of PNT systems is the Global Positioning System (GPS), which is widely used for navigation and location-based services. *2 MetCom, Inc. MetCom, Inc. is a provider of wide-area high-precision 3D location information that visualizes "what, when, and where.". The company’s 3D PNT service that can be used seamlessly both outdoors and indoors provides solutions to major challenges faced by GPS—indoor/underground positioning, vertical positioning and security issues. NextNav, a U.S. company and the global leader in this field, is a major shareholder of MetCom. Based on a partnership with NextNav, MetCom will achieve the world’s highest standard positioning service. The company’s goal is to achieve a safe and secure society in Japan as well as to develop and operate social infrastructure that offers highly convenient lives for the people of the country. https://metcom.jp/External Link *3 JAXA Space Innovation through Partnership and Co-creation (J-SPARC) J-SPARC (JAXA Space Innovation through Partnership and Co-creation) is a co-creative R&D program that starts through dialogue between JAXA and companies in the private sector that aim for space business. Based on their respective commitments to commercialization, JAXA and the companies will jointly make examinations for a business concept and develop and demonstrate technologies in an exit-oriented manner toward gaining new technologies for the creation of a new business. This co-creative R&D program was launched in May 2018, and so far under the program, about a total of 40 projects and activities were conducted, which also contributed to the launch (commercialization and start of service) of various businesses by companies in the private sector, including those related to food, daily goods, education, VR, entertainment, avatar, communication and small satellite constellations. For the co-creation of a business concept, activities such as market research and concept examination will be conducted, and for the joint demonstration of a new business, activities such as joint feasibility study for commercialization as well as joint technological development and demonstration will be conducted. https://aerospacebiz.jaxa.jp/solution/j-sparc/ *4 MADOCA-PPP (Multi-GNSS Advanced Demonstration tool for Orbit and Clock Analysis-Precise Point Positioning) MADOCA is software developed by JAXA to achieve high-precision multiple global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) orbit and clock estimation. MADOCA-PPP is a high-precision positioning augmentation service aimed at achieving centimeter-level positioning based on augmented information generated by MADOCA. The Cabinet Office is scheduled to officially start providing the distribution service from QZSS in 2024. JAXA is working to improve the functional performance of MADOCA, while also developing the technology required to support the diverse applications of high-precision positioning using MADOCA-PPP. *5 Array antenna technology Technology to enhance resistance to radio interference by using array antenna. The Aviation Safety Innovation Hub of JAXA’s Aviation Technology Directorate, Mitsubishi Precision Company, Limited, Chubu University, Osaka Metropolitan University, and the National Institute of Technology (Kosen), Nagano College are jointly implementing research and development under the theme, “Research for practical application of GPS interference signal suppression based on CRPA technology.” < Comment from HIRASAWA Hiroki, Representative Director, MetCom, Inc. > The social mission of MetCom is to turn location information into genuine social infrastructure that can be used whenever, wherever and by whomever. With the aim of fulfilling the social mission, MetCom strives to provide seamless indoor/outdoor 3D PNT service by using terrestrial PNT systems to solve the structural issues posed by satellite positioning systems while securing compatibility with them. Through this co-creation initiative with JAXA, we will combine the high interference resistance based on the directivity of QZSS and MetCom’s high signal reception strength distinctive to terrestrial systems, and in addition, capitalize on MADOCA-PPP’s time information, which is higher in accuracy by double digits. Through this endeavor, we hope to establish a highly stable and reliable positioning system and timing service in Japan, thereby contributing to ensuring safety and security of society and enhancing convenience. < Comment from KOGURE Satoshi, Senior Chief Officer of Satellite Navigation Technology, Space Technology Directorate I, JAXA > At JAXA’s Satellite Navigation Unit, we are engaging in R&D on the sophistication of the MADOCA software, which conducts precise orbit/clock estimation for QSZZ, GPS, Galileo, GLONASS and BDS and the use of correction information for high-precision positioning generated by MADOCA, and are seeking for social implementation. We engage in these initiatives in partnerships with POC-DC Ltd. and CORE CORPORATION. The use of high-precision positioning services including centimeter-level positioning has been drawing attention primarily from the perspective of user positioning accuracy. Under the collaborative initiative with MetCom, we will be working together to sophisticate and commercialize MetCom’s terrestrial PNT and time synchronization services as a way to find new applications for high-precision timing obtained simultaneously with location information. I have been personally engaging in R&D of indoor/outdoor seamless positioning using the indoor messaging system (IMES), so I would be delighted to make a significant contribution to achieving seamless positioning through this co-creation project. I also believe that the services will mitigate the vulnerability of satellite positioning systems and enhance the reliability of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) called as “flying cars” and drone delivery, so I will work hard to contribute to the sophistication of the services. < Comment from FUJIWARA Takeshi, Hub Manager, Aviation Safety Innovation Hub, Aviation Technology Directorate, JAXA > JAXA’s Aviation Safety Innovation Hub conducts R&D on technology for increasing interference resistance upon receiving signals from GPS and other positioning satellites by using array antenna with the aim of enhancing the reliability of satellite positioning. Array antenna, in principle, requires large antenna aperture areas, making it virtually impossible to mount on small mobile objects such as mobile terminals and small drones. However, if the co-creation with MetCom’s planned terrestrial PNT system succeeds, array antenna will only need to be installed at a small number of ground base stations, enabling us to provide small mobile users with reliable positioning service. The development of electronic equipment has been increasing our vulnerability to radio waves. We hope to contribute to the realization of a safe and secure society through our R&D on array antenna technology.

It is therefore important to select components based on accurate measurement results to minimize outgassing from materials as much as possible. The Twin-QCM sensor jointly developed by NDK and JAXA is a twin sensor system with a reference electrode and a measurement electrode on a single quartz crystal, eliminating the problems of characteristic differences between quartz crystal and variations in temperature that have been issues with conventional products. In addition, conventional products had to be sent back to the manufacturer each time a quartz crystal needed to be replaced, resulting in downtime and greater expense, but the Twin-QCM allows users to replace quartz crystal themselves quickly and inexpensively. This Twin-QCM for ground use has already been sold to many domestic and overseas space equipment development users. NDK and JAXA are hoping through this collaboration to carry out application development of a space flight model of this Japanese QCM sensor that offers excellent accuracy and usability and then to demonstrate it in orbit. The partners intend to establish in-orbit environment measurement technology for space-specific applications such as atomic oxygen (AO) in addition to outgassing measurement technology. Flight-use Twin-QCM systemEM sensor module (front), EM controller (right) (Engineering Model (EM): prototype model currently under evaluation) ©NDK In the background is synthetic quartz crystal, the material used for quartz crystal sensor [Background to co-creation activities] NDK will develop a flight-use Twin-QCM and search out potential customers. More specifically, NDK will design and evaluate the reliability of Twin-QCMs for rocket launch and in-orbit environments. In addition, NDK will add on storage functions to cope with the limited communication environment in orbit. In parallel, the company will conduct research on new markets and new customers for space applications. JAXA will explore new applications and provide development support. More specifically, JAXA will be seeking out new applications for space-use QCM sensors beyond contamination measurement while establishing measurement technology. With a view to installing these sensors aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as a potential platform for in-orbit demonstrations, JAXA will also provide support in meeting the stipulated safety requirements, etc., and will research and consider other demonstration platforms to secure opportunities for in-orbit demonstrations. These efforts will enable JAXA to develop new applications for space-use QCM sensors with an eye to future use in exploration. Through this joint project, NDK and JAXA are looking to complete development in FY2024 and conduct an in-orbit demonstration in FY2025. If successful in these endeavors, the partners will push to make Japanese QCM sensors for both ground and space applications a global standard. *1 Nihon Dempa Kogyo Co., Ltd. Since its establishment in 1948, Nihon Dempa Kogyo has been engaged in the cultivation of synthetic quartz crystals and the manufacture and sale of quartz crystal devices. NDK has been expanding use of its quartz devices, which have a high market share in the automotive electronics sector, into the space sector. In addition, the company has been selling Twin-QCM, an outgas analysis system using quartz crystals as sensors, for ground applications since 2019, and will be striving to develop a flight model of this system for use in space through this co-creation activity. https://www.ndk.com/en/products/qcm/ *2 QCM sensor: high-precision gas measurement sensor A sensor for measuring gases emitted from materials for space use in a vacuum environment (outgases). The measurement is based on the QCM method, which itself stems from the principle of the mass load effect, in which frequency decreases in proportion to the mass of a substance absorbing to the electrodes of a quartz crystal. It was developed in 2017 through joint research by NDK and JAXA and is being marketed domestically and internationally. Press Release: "Development of High-Precision Gas Measurement Sensor Made in Japan" (March 10, 2017) Press Release: "Overseas Sales of High Precision Gas Measurement Sensor (Twin-QCM Sensor)" (July 12, 2019) *3 JAXA Space Innovation Partnership through Partnership and Co-creation (J-SPARC) JAXA Space Innovation through Partnership and Co-creation (J-SPARC) is a co-creation R&D program that starts with dialogues between JAXA and private companies, etc., seeking to get into the space business; once both parties are committed to commercialization, they jointly examine business concepts and develop and demonstrate exit-oriented technologies, etc., to acquire new technologies and create new businesses. Launched in May 2018, this program has thus far pursued about 40 projects and activities and has helped private companies start businesses (commercialize products, go live with systems, etc.) in the food, lifestyle products, education, VR, entertainment, avatar, communication, and small satellite constellation businesses. In business concept co-creation, program partners conduct market research and study business concepts, while in joint business demonstrations, they carry out joint feasibility studies and joint technology development and demonstration prior to commercialization. https://aerospacebiz.jaxa.jp/solution/j-sparc/（Japanese Only） *4 Outgases Outgases refers to gases unintentionally released from organic materials in a vacuum environment. It is desirable to minimize outgassing from materials for space use and equipment because it becomes a source of contamination through condensation and adsorption. <Mr. Hiroki Kimura, Manager, Chitose Technical Center, Nihon Dempa Kogyo Co., Ltd.> Based on our earlier development of an outgassing analysis system for ground use with JAXA, our development of an engineering model (EM) for space use utilizing the Space Exploration Innovation Hub''s problem-solving approaches, and our proposals to, and information obtained through interviews with, space agencies in the United States and Europe, we are confident and honored that our Japanese technology will help expand space activities, exploration, utilization, and space business worldwide. We will strive to enhance the performance and functions of our products and ensure space quality so that they can be widely employed. <Dr. Eiji Miyazaki, Senior Researcher, Research Unit I, Research and Development Directorate, JAXA> I have carried on the research in contamination phenomena for spacecraft for more than a decade. Sensing device is one of key technologies in contamination research field, that is, "QCM sensor." Through my research work, I have a motivation to develop new QCM sensor. Then, I met NDK colleagues, creating and growing Twin-QCM together. In this co-creation activity, I will exert my efforts to establish an experiment in orbit to measure the space environment.

The telemetry data were sent directly from the small robot. According to telemetry data, after deployment from SLIM, LEV-1 executed planned leaping movements and direct communication with ground stations, including inter-robot test radio wave data transmission from the Transformable Lunar Robot (LEV-2, nicknamed "SORA-Q"). On the other hand, image acquisition on the lunar surface has not been confirmed as of now. Currently, LEV-1 has completed its planned operational period on the lunar surface, depleted its designated power, and is in a standby state on the lunar surface. While the capability to resume activity exists contingent on solar power generation from changes in the direction of the sun, efforts will be maintained to continue receiving signals from LEV-1. Both LEV-1 and LEV-2 have become Japan''s first lunar exploration robots. Additionally, the small LEV-1 with a mass of 2.1 kg (including a 90g communication device), achieved successful direct communication with Earth from the moon. This is considered as the world''s smallest and lightest case of direct data transmission from approximately 380,000 kilometers away. Furthermore, the accomplishment of LEV-1''s leaping movements on the lunar surface, inter-robot communication between LEV-1 and LEV-2, and fully autonomous operations represent groundbreaking achievement. It would be regarded as a valuable technology demonstration for future lunar explorations, and the acquired knowledge and experience will be applied in upcoming missions. Moreover, the transmission of UHF band radio waves from LEV-1 as part of outreach efforts has encouraged participation from amateur radio operators globally, and we have been receiving reports of successful signal receptions. This initiative provided an opportunity for the public to be directly engaged in lunar exploration missions. We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to everyone involved in the LEV-1 mission.

However, due to the spacecraft not being at the planned attitude upon landing, power generation was not possible from the solar cells, and the spacecraft was shutdown with a command from the ground at 2:57 am JST. Analysis of the data acquired before shutting down the power confirmed that SLIM had reached the Moon’s surface approximately 55m east of the original target landing site. The positional accuracy before the commencement of the obstacle avoidance maneuver (at around a 50m altitude) which indicates the pinpoint landing performance, was evaluated to be at approximately 10m or less, possibly about 3 - 4m. While more detailed evaluation continues, it is reasonable to mention that the technology demonstration of pinpoint landing within an accuracy of 100m, which has been declared to be the main mission of SLIM, has been achieved. All technical data on the navigation guidance leading to the landing, and navigation camera image data captured during the descent and on the lunar surface that is necessary for future pinpoint landing technology, was obtained from the spacecraft. The small probes (LEV-1 and LEV-2) were successfully separated just prior to landing in this contingency situation. The multi-band spectroscopic camera (MBC) onboard SLIM was also operated on a trial basis and captured images until the power was turned off. Regarding the circumstances of how SLIM became stationary on the lunar surface at an attitude that could not generate power from the solar cells, the acquired technical data revealed that at an altitude of 50m just prior to the start of the obstacle avoidance maneuver, the thrust from one of the two main engines was most likely lost. Under these circumstances, the SLIM onboard software autonomously identifies the anomaly, and while controlling the horizontal position as much as possible, SLIM continued the descent with the other engine and moved gradually towards the east. The descent velocity at the time of contact with the ground was approximately 1.4 m/s or less, which was below the design range., but conditions such as the lateral velocity and attitude were outside the design range, and this is thought to have resulted in a different attitude than planned. The cause of the loss of the main engine functionality is now being investigated, including consideration of external factors aside from the engine itself, with the plan to determine the detailed cause. We will provide further information as the investigation progresses. Regarding future activities, further analysis of the acquired technical and scientific data, as well as analysis of the cause of the anomalies that occurred, will proceed. Analysis of the data has shown that SLIM’s solar cells are currently facing west, suggesting that there is the possibility for power generation and thus recovery of SLIM as the sunlight illumination condition improves with time. Although SLIM’s activities on the Moon were originally expected to last only a few days, the necessary preparations for recovery will continue in order to acquire further technical and scientific data. We will continue to keep you updated on the status of the project. ■ Image of the lunar surface captured by the SLIM onboard navigation camera after landing (credit: JAXA) Note: the image is rotated to align with the direction of gravity. ■ Estimation of SLIM’s current location and the target landing site (credit: Chandrayaan-2:ISRO/SLIM:JAXA) Note: Lunar topography captured by the Indian spacecraft Chandrayaan-2, overlaid with images acquired by the SLIM navigation camera during the HV2 (second hovering) at an altitude of about 50m. The two blue frames are images acquired during the obstacle detection at HV2. As the spacecraft subsequently enters the obstacle avoidance operation, the performance of the pinpoint landing is evaluated based on the positional accuracy at this point. The positional accuracy at the time of the first and second obstacle detection was respectively about 3 - 4m and 10m. Note that it is highly likely that the main engine was already affected by the loss of function when the second obstacle detection occurred. The SLIM footprint in the red frame is the safe landing zone set autonomously by SLIM based on the obstacle detection during HV2. 小型月着陸実証機（SLIM）および小型プローブ（LEV）の月面着陸の結果・成果等 の記者会見(JAXA Channel)（Japanese Only) External Link Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) Results from the Moon Landing Related Links Press Release Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) SLIM Special Site Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM)(ISAS) Space Exploration Innovation Hub Cetner'),

Following the bus instrument''s preliminary functional verification, Xtend and Resolve underwent meticulous checks and adjustments starting October 7, 2023. The first light observations for each instrument were subsequently conducted.

Credit: JAXA In Figure 1, the image showcases a galaxy cluster, Abell 2319, where the purple hues signify the distribution of high-temperature plasma emitting X-rays. Abell 2319 is a system in which two galaxy clusters are colliding. Xtend''s unique capability to capture the entire cluster in a single observation, revealing the intricate distribution of hot gas associated with each cluster, promises a significant advancement in our comprehension of galaxy clusters and the Universe''s large-scale structure evolution. In Figure 2, we encounter an X-ray spectrum (*2) of the supernova remnant N132D in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The white spectrum from Resolve, exhibiting emission lines (*3) from various ions in the 1,800 -10,000 eV bandwidth, surpasses its predecessor, Suzaku, in separating previously indistinguishable lines. By dividing emission lines, the type and abundance of elements, the temperature and kinetic velocity of the high-temperature gas can be derived much more accurately than before. Resolve''s ultra-high resolution spectroscopic observations and impressive energy spectral accuracy below 5 eV, confirmed in orbit, set the stage for new insights into the Universe''s elemental formation and evolution, which are the basis of stars, planets, and life. Although Resolve''s spectra are still limited to 1,800 eV and above because the Dewar aperture door (*4) to protect the sensitive detector has yet to be opened, this band''s highest emission line sensitivity is evident. The spacecraft maintains optimal conditions, with ongoing commissioning operations aiming for a seamless transition to the calibration and performance verification phases. The bus equipment''s functional verification and the enhanced safety features mark significant milestones. Xtend, with its cooled X-ray CCDs (*5) and Resolve, boasting a cryogenically cooled X-ray microcalorimeter (*6) achieving spectral resolution below 5 eV, are positioned for groundbreaking observations, even with the dewar aperture door closed. Plans include advancing to the calibration and performance verification phases in February 2024 and initiating full-scale observations for initial calibration verification concurrently with efforts to open the dewar aperture door. Scientists and engineers alike are thrilled by these successful first-light observations, foreseeing many groundbreaking discoveries. *1 Xtend: X-ray imaging spectrometer using an X-ray telescope and X-ray CCD; Resolve: X-ray spectrometer using an X-ray telescope and microcalorimeter. Both perform imaging and spectroscopy, but Xtend and Resolve specialize in imaging and spectroscopy. *2 X-ray spectrum: A spectrum that indicates how much of each energy band of X-rays is emitted. *3 Emission line: X-ray emission with the specific energy of each element. Characteristic X-rays. *4 Dewar aperture door: Protective window attached to the X-ray incidence area of the Resolve detector. It protects the sensor from the atmosphere on the ground and prevents outgassing from inside the satellite after launch from adhering to the optical blocking filters inside the Dewar detector. The window section has a 250-micron-thick beryllium film, so functional performance can be checked using X-rays even when the section is closed. The beryllium window shields X-rays below about 2,000 eV, and when the mounting mechanism opens the window, X-rays from 300 eV can be observed. *5 X-ray CCD: Like a visible light telescope, an X-ray CCD can capture and take images of X-rays from celestial objects. The principle is the same as that of commercially available digital cameras. However, the X-ray CCDs are designed with increased sensitivity to X-rays. The X-rays entering the semiconductor are converted into electrons, which are then converted into electrical signals to produce an image. *6 X-ray microcalorimeter is a device that measures the magnitude of energy through the temperature of an X-ray beam rising very slightly when it hits the element.

The deployment of the Queqiao-2 relay satellite is a key step for China''s future lunar exploration missions including Chang''e-6, Chang''e-7 and Chang''e-8. WENCHANG, Hainan, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China launched a new relay satellite on Wednesday to provide Earth-Moon communications services, a key step for its future lunar exploration missions such as retrieving samples from the far side of the moon and exploring the lunar south pole region. A Long March-8 rocket, carrying the satellite dubbed Queqiao-2, or magpie bridge-2, soared into the sky at 8:31 a.m. from the Wenchang Space Launch Site in south China''s Hainan Province. After 24 minutes of flight, the satellite separated from the rocket, and entered the planned Earth-Moon transfer orbit with the perigee at 200 kilometers and the apogee at 420,000 kilometers. The satellite''s solar panels and communications antennae were unfolded, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA). "Today''s launch has laid a good foundation for the ensuing flight control of the Queqiao-2 relay satellite," said Ge Ping, deputy director of the CNSA''s Lunar Exploration and Space Program Center. A Long March-8 rocket, carrying the relay satellite Queqiao-2 for Earth-Moon communications, blasts off at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China''s Hainan Province, March 20, 2024. (Xinhua/Yang Guanyu) However, the successful launch is only the first step of the Queqiao-2 mission. A series of important maneuvers such as midway trajectory correction, decelerating near the moon and orbit adjustment will be carried out before Queqiao-2 enters its target elliptical orbit around the moon to become the world''s second relay satellite deployed beyond Earth orbit. After that, communications tests will be carried out to determine whether the Queqiao-2 relay satellite has the ability to support the sample collection mission from the far side of the moon, Ge said. NEW BRIDGE OF COMMUNICATIONS According to a Chinese folktale, Zhi Nyu, the seventh daughter of the Goddess of Heaven, and her beloved husband, Niu Lang, a humble cowherd, found their love forbidden and were separated to opposite sides of the Milky Way. Moved by their plight, magpies intervened, creating the Queqiao bridge with their wings on the seventh night of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, allowing the couple to reunite for just one day each year. Hence, the name of the satellite, Queqiao, embodies China''s hope that the relay satellite could serve as a vital communication link between Earth-based controllers and the mysterious far side of the moon. Since the moon''s revolution cycle is the same as its rotation cycle, the same side always faces Earth. The other face, most of which cannot be seen from Earth, is called the far side or "dark side" of the moon. This term doesn''t refer to darkness but rather to the mystery shrouding the moon''s largely unexplored terrain. Due to its special environment and complex geological history, the far side of the moon stands as a prime destination for scientific and space exploration. In order to explore the moon''s far side, China sent the first Queqiao relay satellite in 2018 to a halo orbit around the second Lagrangian (L2) point of the Earth-Moon system. Thanks to the communications support and data transmission from this relay satellite, China later successfully sent the Chang''e-4 probe to the Von Karman Crater in the South Pole-Aitken Basin, realizing the first-ever soft landing and roving on the far side of the moon at the beginning of 2019. The combination of the relay satellite Queqiao-2 and the Long March-8 Y3 carrier rocket is vertically transferred to the launching area at the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China''s Hainan Province, March 17, 2024. (Photo by Huang Guochang/Xinhua) Since the first Queqiao satellite has exceeded its designed lifespan, Queqiao-2 will take over the communications relay services for Chang''e-4, which is still operating on the moon''s far side. Compared with the first Queqiao satellite, the new satellite launched on Wednesday boasts enhanced functionality, innovative features and intricate designs. It also carries multiple instruments for scientific exploration, the CNSA said. KEY STEP FOR FUTURE MOON MISSIONS The deployment of the Queqiao-2 relay satellite is a key step for China''s future lunar exploration missions including Chang''e-6, Chang''e-7 and Chang''e-8. The landing and sample collection sites of China''s moon missions in the coming years are mainly in the lunar south pole region or on the far side of the moon. A more powerful relay satellite with more functions is necessary to provide communications and data transmission services for the missions, the CNSA said. Chang''e-6 is scheduled for launch in the first half of 2024, while Chang''e-7 will be launched around 2026, and Chang''e-8 around 2028. Chang''e-7 and Chang''e-8 will form the basic model of a lunar research station to carry out lunar environment exploration, according to the CNSA. In addition to China''s missions, the Queqiao-2 relay satellite can also provide communications services for other country''s lunar exploration missions, the CNSA said. "China has always attached great importance to international cooperation in the lunar exploration program. And many win-win results have been achieved in the previous lunar missions," Ge said. China has initiated the application process for researchers worldwide to study the lunar samples gathered by the Chang''e-5 mission, and also welcomes other countries to cooperate in China''s future lunar and planetary exploration projects, Ge said. Together with Queqiao-2, two communications and navigation technology test satellites Tiandu-1 and Tiandu-2 were also sent into space by the Long March-8 carrier rocket. With a total length of 50.3 meters, the rocket has two stages and two liquid boosters. This is the first time a Long March-8 carrier rocket has been used for a lunar exploration mission. "We have improved and optimized the design of the rocket for the mission to enhance its reliability," said Xu Shanshu, a chief designer for the rocket, from the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology under the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. Wednesday''s launch was the 512th mission of the Long March rocket series. (Video reporters: Zhao Yuhe, Li Duojiang, Mei Yuanlong; Video editors: Li Ziwei, Hui Peipei)'),

The satellite is in good condition, its subsystems are functioning properly, and its performance meets all the standards as intended, said the CNSA. The satellite, known as Gaofen-5 01A, was launched into space on Dec. 9, 2022. It can provide high-quality hyperspectral data for diverse fields, such as environmental monitoring, natural resource surveys, and climate change studies. The satellite provides important data support for ecological environmental protection and pollution reduction work, said Zhao Jian, director of the Earth Observation System and Data Center of the CNSA. The CNSA also released on Tuesday the application products delivered by the satellite, including global ozone column concentration monitoring map, soil moisture monitoring map, sea ice monitoring map, water quality monitoring map and other hyperspectral data images. "These application products are an important basis for national ecological monitoring, climate change response and natural resource surveys," Zhao said. The satellite runs in the sun''s synchronous regression orbit, 705 kilometers above Earth. According to the CNSA, the satellite carries payloads including a camera covering visible-to-shortwave infrared spectral range, an atmospheric trace gas differential absorption spectrometer, and a wide-range thermal infrared imaging device. The camera covering visible-to-shortwave infrared spectral range plays an important role in water pollution control, ecological environment monitoring, mineral resources surveys, etc. It has also made new progress in the monitoring of methane anomalous emission sources. The atmospheric trace gas differential absorption spectrometer has enabled daily dynamic monitoring of ozone, nitrogen dioxide and other pollutant gases, providing important support to global atmospheric environment monitoring and governance. Meanwhile, the wide-range thermal infrared imaging device is used in remote sensing monitoring operations, such as straw burning monitoring, sea ice monitoring, and river and sea outfall monitoring. With all the payloads, the satellite has achieved the global coverage of atmospheric environmental soundings once a day and global round-the-clock coverage of the land surface environment once every two days, said Zhao. Launched in 2010, the Gaofen project has become the backbone network of China''s high-resolution Earth observation system. It has promoted the construction of a national space infrastructure system integrating satellite communication, satellite remote sensing and satellite navigation.'),

ZHU XINGXIN/CHINA DAILY The first launch service tower was completed at Hainan International Commercial Aerospace Launch Center in Wenchang, a coastal city in the island province of Hainan, on Dec 29, the last work day of 2023. However, work continues at the center for its maiden launch, which is expected to take place around June. When put into operation, the center will become the fifth ground-based launch complex in China and the first dedicated to serving commercial space missions rather than government-funded programs. In China, a commercial space mission generally refers to a space activity paid for by a business entity rather than a government department. Construction of the new center, which began in July 2022, was undertaken by China Aerospace Construction Group. China''s first man in space Yang Liwei (third from left) bids farewell to the Shenzhou XVII mission crew at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in October. ZHU XINGXIN/CHINA DAILY The No 1 service tower is about 90 meters high and incorporates the latest rocket-launch technologies. It is specifically tasked with servicing Long March 8 carrier rockets. Developed by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, a subsidiary of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, the Long March 8 family consists of multiple medium-lift launch vehicles designated for commercial space missions. Yang Tianliang, chairman of Hainan International Commercial Aerospace Launch Co, owner of the new center, said the complex''s debut mission scheduled for June will be performed by a Long March 8 rocket lifting off from the No 1 service tower. The new center project is a joint venture by the Hainan provincial government and three State-owned space conglomerates — China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, and China Satellite Network Group. The astronauts for the Shenzhou XV mission, Fei Junlong (center), Deng Qingming (right) and Zhang Lu, train in a simulated cabin in March 2022. XU BU/FOR CHINA DAILY There is already a launch complex in Hainan — the Wenchang Space Launch Center. Like the other three such centers in China — Jiuquan, Taiyuan, and Xichang — it is administered by the central government and is primarily tasked with serving State programs such as lunar explorations and manned spaceflights. The Hainan provincial government has said it intends to make the new site a leading launch facility that will be fully commercially managed to support the long-term growth of the nation''s commercial space industry. Thanks to the central government''s encouragement and favorable policies, more Chinese private companies have become involved in satellite businesses ranging from design and manufacturing to in-orbit operations and data processing, generating huge demand for commercial launch services. Several private enterprises have announced or begun to implement plans to establish space-based networks with tens or even hundreds of satellites for broadband internet or data collection businesses. Hu Shengyun, a senior rocket designer at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp, said the existing government-run launch centers are too busy to handle rising demand from the commercial space sector. It is also not uncommon for even a government-assigned mission to have to await scheduling at those sites. Each of the existing centers has only one or two service towers, and important State missions such as crewed flights always have priority, Hu said. "Moreover, the management and operational methods of these centers are specifically designed for State-funded programs rather than commercial missions, so carrying out numerous commercial launches will likely create problems or challenges for them," he added. Yang said construction of a second launch service tower at the center in Hainan is expected to be finished next month. Installation and fine-tuning work on this tower is due to be completed in May, he said, adding that it will be able to service as many as 19 types of rockets, most of them produced by private companies. A total of 41 satellites are placed inside a Long March 2D carrier rocket before their launch in Taiyuan, Shanxi province. CHINA DAILY New power Private enterprises have become a new power in China''s rocket industry, with their growth being fast-tracked. Last year, when the nation carried out 67 rocket launches, 12 rockets built by Chinese private companies were used to send satellites into space, far more than in previous years. In April, the first TL 2 rocket, developed by the startup Space Pioneer, which is based in Beijing, reached orbit on its maiden flight, becoming the first privately built, liquid-fuel rocket in China to do so. Lifting off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China, it placed a remote-sensing satellite in a sun-synchronous orbit about 500 kilometers above the Earth. It was the first time any privately developed, liquid-propellant carrier rocket in the world had succeeded in its first orbital attempt — a powered flight that places a craft in orbit in outer space. Before the TL 2, all liquid-propellant rockets developed by private enterprises, including SpaceX and Virgin Orbit in the United States and China''s LandSpace, failed on their first orbital attempt. The successful launch also saw Space Pioneer become the third private company in China to carry out an orbital mission. Previously, i-Space and Galactic Energy, which are both based in Beijing, achieved the feat using their own solid-propellant rockets. Such rockets are easier to design and make than liquid-fuel rockets, but their smaller capacity means they cannot launch large satellites or deploy spacecraft to high orbits. Wang Yanan, editor-in-chief of Aerospace Knowledge magazine, said the TL 2''s success is a milestone for China''s space industry, as it shows that the nation''s private players have grown strong enough to undertake important tasks previously only conducted by State-owned giants. The Lingxi 03 satellite is carried into space in July. CHINA DAILY TL 2, which stands for Tianlong 2 or Sky Dragon 2, is 32.8 meters high, 3.35 meters wide and has a liftoff weight of 153 metric tons. Space Pioneer said the rocket can send satellites with a combined weight of 1.5 tons to a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 500 km, or spacecraft weighing two tons to a low-Earth orbit. In July, the ZQ 2, short for Zhuque 2 or Rosefinch 2, a rocket developed by LandSpace, succeeded in its second attempt to reach orbit, becoming the world''s first methane-fueled rocket to complete an orbital mission. Last month, the third flight of the ZQ 2, now the largest and most powerful private rocket in China, was successfully conducted. The maiden ZQ 2 flight took place in December 2022 from the Jiuquan center. The rocket successfully crossed the Karman Line, the globally recognized boundary between the Earth''s atmosphere and the edge of space, but malfunctioned on its second stage and failed to reach orbit. This was also the first attempt in the world to achieve orbit with a methane-fueled rocket. The ZQ 2 is 49.5 meters high and has a diameter of 3.35 meters. With a liftoff weight of 219 tons, it can place a four-ton satellite into a typical sun-synchronous orbit about 500 km above the Earth, or a six-ton satellite into a low-Earth orbit at an altitude of 200 km. The rocket''s main propulsion system — the TQ 12 — is the first methane engine in China. Before LandSpace, only a handful of companies in the US had developed such engines. Compared with traditional types of rocket engines that can function only once, a methane engine is reusable and more environmentally friendly. Yang Yuguang, a senior space industry observer and vice-chair of the International Astronautical Federation''s Space Transportation Committee, said methane engines are widely recognized as the most suitable propulsion system for reusable rockets. Engineers worldwide had been working to develop reusable engines for many years, but it took a lot of money and time to perform maintenance on those engines used previously before they could be reused, Yang said. "By contrast, methane engines promise the most convenient checks and maintenance for reuse, saving a considerable amount of time and money," he added. The Smart Dragon 3 rocket lifts off from waters off the coast of Guangdong province in December. ZHANG JINGYI/FOR CHINA DAILY In September, Galactic Energy became the first Chinese private company to carry out a sea-based launch mission. The seaborne variant of its Ceres 1 rocket lifted off from a mobile launch platform — the deck of a modified barge — in the Yellow Sea off the eastern province of Shandong. It sent four satellites into orbit about 800 km above Earth. The Ceres 1 is the third Chinese rocket model, and the first made by the private sector, capable of lifting off from land and sea. Xia Dongkun, a vice-president at Galactic Energy, said a sea-based launch gives the company an alternative to the nation''s land-based launch facilities that are busy handling government-backed programs. "This enables us to make more launches each year," Xia said. To date, Galactic Energy has carried out 11 Ceres 1 launches, far outperforming other private competitors. Last year, it made seven launches — six of them successful. Gui Haichao, the Shenzhou XVI mission''s science payload specialist and the first Chinese civilian in space, receives underwater training. XU BU/FOR CHINA DAILY Satellite technologies Private players have also come of age in the satellite field to become a flourishing seedbed for technological innovation and creativity. GalaxySpace, a leading private satellite maker, built China''s first satellite equipped with a flexible solar array and deployed it into space in July. The satellite, Lingxi 03, is a plate-shaped communications satellite. It has a millimeter-wave multibeam digital payload, which features a transmission capacity of tens of gigabits per second. Zhang Shijie, a senior spacecraft researcher and GalaxySpace''s chief scientist, said the satellite''s main task is to verify a next-generation low-Earth-orbit broadband communication system and other satellite technologies, including an ultra-large energy system and active thermal control. He said the Lingxi 03''s flexible solar wing is a major technological feat, because such apparatus has proved through the construction of massive satellite networks by foreign companies to be crucial in establishing an internet satellite system. "The solar wing has been working well and the results of its trial run were better than we expected," Zhang said. Researchers examine the capsule of the Shenzhou XVI manned spaceship after it touches down at the Dongfeng Landing Site in Inner Mongolia autonomous region in October. ZHU XINGXIN/CHINA DAILY Zhu Zhengxian, chief technology officer at GalaxySpace, said the solar wing is extremely thin — each layer is only about 1 mm thick — and when the wing is folded inside the rocket before launch, it is only 5 centimeters thick. "When fully unfolded in space, the array is about nine meters long and more than 2.5 meters wide. It is characterized by its small folded size, light weight and modular design," he said. Deployment of the satellite also marked the first in-orbit verification of China''s multisatellite stack deployment method, which is used when a rocket is required to put a number of plate-shaped satellites into orbit. "This method will play a major role in the rapid deployment of multiple communication satellites in low orbit," Zhu said. Last year, Ellipspace, another private satellite maker based in Beijing, launched four remote-sensing satellites in its Starpool 1 network, marking the start of its ambitious plan to establish a large space-based system consisting of more than 100 satellites. Remote-sensing satellites are tasked with detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of objects on land or at sea by measuring the targets'' reflected and emitted radiation. Di Fengping, president of Ellipspace, said the company plans to use the network to obtain data for users in businesses such as oil and electricity infrastructure patrol work, protection of animals and nature reserves, agricultural insurance, emergency response, disaster relief, and marine infrastructure maintenance. The network is due to be completed by 2027.'),

The administration said in a news release on Wednesday that components of the Chang''e 6 probe were transported by two military cargo planes to Haikou, capital of Hainan province, on Monday and Tuesday, and were then carried by trucks to the Wenchang Space Launch Center on the east coast of the island province. The probe will be assembled and undergo prelaunch checks at the center, it noted, adding that preparatory work is underway at all systems involved in the coming mission. Like Chang''e 5, its predecessor, the Chang''e 6 spacecraft consists of four components – an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a re-entry module. Its operational process will also mimic that of the Chang''e 5. After the probe reaches lunar orbit, the components will separate into two parts, with the orbiter and re-entry module remaining in orbit while the lander and ascender head for the moon''s surface. The lander/ascender combination will make a soft landing and then start using a drill and a mechanical arm to gather lunar rocks and soil. Once the surface operations are done, the ascender''s rocket will elevate it to lunar orbit to dock with the re-entry module. It will transfer samples to the module, which will carry them to Earth. The United States, the former Soviet Union and China have brought lunar samples back to Earth, but none has ever obtained samples from the far side of the moon. Tidal forces on Earth slow the moon''s rotation to the point where the same side always faces Earth. The other side, most of which is never visible from Earth, is the moon''s far side. Though the far side had been extensively photographed by spacecraft, starting with a Soviet probe in 1959, no probe had ever touched down on it until China''s Chang''e 4 mission, which landed in the Von Karman crater in the South Pole-Aitken Basin in January 2019.'),

(Xinhua/Jin Liwang) BEIJING, Dec. 22 (Xinhua) -- China welcomes scientists from all over the world, including those from the United States, to apply for lunar samples through appropriate channels in accordance with application procedures issued by the country, a spokesperson for the China National Space Administration (CNSA) said Friday. Xu Hongliang made the statement in response to recent remarks by U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns, noting that China attaches great importance to international cooperation in space and is always open to space exchanges with the United States. According to a China Daily report, when attending a lecture hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations, a think tank in Washington, on Dec. 12, Burns responded to a request for his perspective on China-U.S. space collaboration by saying that he does not believe "the Chinese have shown much of an interest in working with the U.S." in space. Xu expressed bewilderment over the apparent contradiction where the United States emphasizes cooperation, while some people in that country praise the Wolf Amendment that restricts space cooperation with China and even advocate for its permanence. "I don''t understand whether the United States is playing with words or passing the buck," Xu said. The Chinese government has always been committed to exploring and using outer space for peaceful purposes, carrying out international space exchanges and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, peaceful use and inclusive development, and actively promoting the building of a community with a shared future for humanity in outer space, he added. According to the CNSA, the space agencies of China and the United States in 2006 established a working group mechanism on Earth science, space science and other space cooperation, and carried out many exchanges on areas of common interest. The Wolf Amendment adopted by the United States in 2011 then negatively impacted exchanges between the space agencies of the two countries. The United States in 2015 proposed the establishment of a China-U.S. civil space dialogue mechanism led by its State Department, to which China responded actively. So far, three dialogue meetings have been held, but the fourth one to be hosted by the United States has not yet been convened, despite China''s repeated efforts. Up to now, the CNSA has signed more than 170 cooperation agreements or memorandums of understanding with more than 50 countries, space agencies and international organizations on behalf of the Chinese government. China looks forward to more extensive and in-depth international exchanges and cooperation in space with other countries for the scientific research and the common good of humanity, said the statement.'),

The HY-3A satellite was launched atop a Long March 2C carrier rocket at 11:55 am from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China. The satellite successfully reached its preset orbit shortly after liftoff. Developed by the China Academy of Space Technology in Beijing, the HY-3A is designed to monitor ocean colors and features world-class operational capability. It is equipped with a variety of advanced equipment, including a marine color and temperature scanner and a coastline imager. The satellite is expected to work for at least eight years and will collaborate with the HY-1C and HY-1D satellites. Data obtained by the HY-1C and HY-1D satellites has been used in the monitoring and forecast of incidents such as green tide, typhoons, and oil spills, as well as in the mariculture sector. Users of the new satellite include the Ministry of Natural Resources, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, and the China Meteorological Administration. The Long March 2C rocket is 43 meters long and 3.35 meters wide, with a liftoff weight of 242.5 metric tons. The rocket is primarily used to deploy satellites to low-Earth and sun-synchronous orbits. The mission was the 497th flight of the Long March rocket family, China''s main launch vehicle fleet.');

I am currently in Finland pursuing a PHD in Turku University, my research focusing on neutron stars.', 'Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light; I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.  -Sarah Williams, ''The Old Astronomer to His Pupil''', 0, 0, 1, '55a97a96-ac87-4e6c-aa43-033162f7c318'),
