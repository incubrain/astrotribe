# PostHog Setup Guide for A/B Testing and Analytics

## 1. Initial Setup

1. Sign up for a PostHog account if you haven't already.
2. Create a new project for your application.
3. Get your project API key from the project settings.

## 2. Install PostHog in Your Nuxt Application

1. Install the PostHog client library:
   ```
   npm install posthog-js
   ```
2. Set up the PostHog plugin in your Nuxt app as we discussed earlier.

## 3. Configure Event Capture

1. In the PostHog dashboard, go to "Data Management" > "Events".
2. Create event definitions for each of your main event types (e.g., "User Acquisition",
   "Onboarding", "User Engagement", etc.).
3. For each event, define properties that you expect to capture.

## 4. Set Up Properties

1. Go to "Data Management" > "Properties".
2. Define and describe the properties you'll be using across different events.

## 5. Create Dashboards

1. Go to "Dashboards" and create a new dashboard for each main category:
   - User Acquisition Dashboard
   - Onboarding Dashboard
   - User Engagement Dashboard
   - Content Performance Dashboard
   - Job Market Activity Dashboard
   - Technical Performance Dashboard
2. In each dashboard, add relevant charts and metrics based on the events and properties you've
   defined.

## 6. Set Up Funnels

1. Go to "Product Analytics" > "Funnels".
2. Create funnels for important user journeys, such as:
   - Sign-up process
   - Onboarding steps
   - Job application process

## 7. Configure Cohorts

1. Go to "Persons & Cohorts" > "Cohorts".
2. Create cohorts based on user behaviors or properties, such as:
   - Active users (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Users who have completed onboarding
   - Job seekers vs. employers

## 8. Set Up A/B Testing (Experiments)

1. Go to "Experiments" in the PostHog dashboard.
2. Click "New Experiment" to create a new A/B test.
3. Define your experiment:
   - Name: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., "Homepage CTA Button Color")
   - Description: Explain the purpose and hypothesis of the experiment
   - Feature Flag: Create a new feature flag or select an existing one
   - Variants: Define your control and variant(s) (e.g., "blue" and "green")
   - Goal Metrics: Select the events that will determine the success of your experiment
4. Set the percentage of users who will be part of the experiment.
5. Launch the experiment when ready.

## 9. Configure Feature Flags

1. Go to "Feature Flags" in the PostHog dashboard.
2. Create feature flags for each feature or component you want to A/B test.
3. Set up the distribution of these flags (e.g., 50% see version A, 50% see version B).

## 10. Set Up Alerts

1. Go to "Alerts" in the PostHog dashboard.
2. Set up alerts for important metrics or events, such as:
   - Sudden drop in user engagement
   - Spike in error rates
   - Reaching a certain number of job applications

## 11. Configure Data Management

1. Go to "Data Management" > "Aggregation".
2. Set up aggregation queries for complex metrics that require data processing.

## 12. Set Up User Identification

1. Ensure your `identifyUser` function in the analytics composable is correctly calling PostHog's
   identify method.
2. In PostHog, go to "Data Management" > "Persons" to verify that user data is being correctly
   associated.

## 13. Test Your Setup

1. Use your application with the analytics and A/B testing composables implemented.
2. Check the PostHog dashboard to ensure events are being captured correctly.
3. Verify that your A/B tests are running as expected.
4. Make sure your dashboards are populating with real data.

## 14. Implement Consent Management (if necessary)

1. If you're operating in regions with strict privacy laws (e.g., GDPR), set up a consent management
   system.
2. Use the `opt_in_capturing()` and `opt_out_capturing()` methods provided by PostHog in your
   consent management flow.

Remember to regularly review and refine your analytics setup as your application evolves and your
data needs change.
